ODE model (subheading)

In contrast to [76], we merge dead and recovered stages to a single removed stage, as both do not influence the infection dynamics further (we assume immunity after recovery. Note that perfect and permanent immunity is not given for COVID-19. In this study, we ignore the impact of re-infected individuals. The fraction of individuals in each compartment evolves according to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given in Fig 2b. Unlike network-based models, ODE models admit a semantics that is invariant to the population size. Thus, we assume that the population is normalized. A further difference to [76] is that we only have a single infection parameter γ. All other parameters have a meaningful clinical interpretation and can be specified accordingly (cf. Table 1). The set of transition parameters γ, μj, βj gives raise to a specific R0. We can compute R0 by assuming that an infinitesimal fraction � (representing patient zero in an infinitely large population) is infected (I1) and that the rest of the population (1 − �) is susceptible.

We do note upfront that we are only interested in qualitative results and do not rely on exact parameter values.

Limitations

Naturally, mathematical modeling is based on assumptions and abstractions. However, heterogeneity seems to be particularly vital and excluding it should only be done with great caution. It is particularly difficult to capture population heterogeneity in the widely-used class of ODE models. This is due to their inherent homogeneity assumptions w.r.t. each compartment. Although effects such as overdispersion can be modelled to some extent using this paradigm [90], the complex interplay of varying infectiousness and connectivity remains mostly elusive for such models. Discussing epidemics in terms of population averages may not adequately reflect the complexity of the emerging dynamics.

On a high-level, this work highlights limitations of certain model classes and shows that subtle differences in assumptions can make important differences. For future work, it would be interesting to study the effects of heterogeneity and their implications for NPIs empirically. Moreover, we plan to test implications of further sources of heterogeneity, for instance regarding compliance with NPIs, susceptibility to infections, or whether people tend to meet indoors or outdoors.",Yes,www.github.com/gerritgr/Covid19Dispersion,No,,One discipline,Computer and Information Sciences,"Information sciences, studies","Saarland Informatics Campus, Saarland University, Saarbru¨cken, Germany",No,,None,,Yes,"The number of simulation runs is enough to estimate the mean fractions (and the standard deviations) corresponding to each compartment with high accuracy (confidence intervals are not shown but would be barely visible anyway).

To test the potential effect of mask
wearing we simulate the use of masks with different efficacies in all settings outside the shelter, with the exception of play groups, and with variable rates of compliance.

The range within which we vary these interaction intensities (20–90%) corresponds to the changes in interaction intensities that result from various combinations of physical distancing, mask wearing, and increasing ventilation.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations," We assumed, for practical reasons, that an individual has at most one relevant comorbidity that would affect the probability of severe infection.

We currently assume that household and shelter 
compositions are fixed, along with the learning center attended by each enrolled child.

To better reflect the specific evolution of the virus in the Cox’s Bazar settlement, we accounted for comorbidities which are assumed to affect the probability of severe COVID-19 infection.

For simplicity, in the baseline model we assume that all symptomatic individuals with mild symptoms self-quarantine in their shelter with a low compliance of 30% (each individual has a 70% chance of breaking quarantine at each time-step) to account for difficulty in communicating quarantine procedures, as well as the inability of many individuals to properly quarantine given certain basic needs [31].

While we could also specify certain geographic regions in which mask wearing takes place, at present we assume that the location specific compliance factor, C(L), refers to all relevant locations in the settlement.

One of the main limitations of this work so far has been the possible validation of model predictions with real world data—since case and testing data availability has also been limited.

Indeed, the parameter values chosen when presenting the results of possible interventions are designed to explore a large region of parameter space and

This assumption makes the presented model significantly different from the ones currently dominant in the field.

Indeed, there are different models in which some external force, either a periodic, e.g., seasonality [2], or purely stochastic [3], here for the SIS model, force, assuming the susceptibility of an individual recovering from a disease, is used.

We start from two assumptions: • every infection is a result of the interaction between infected and susceptible, • we have to find the network of interpersonal connections initially and then model the spread of an illness.

Instead of creating links between the existing nodes, the preferential character of this growth is assumed, which governs the creation of a graph corresponding to a community network.

It is a fundamental assumption that this community is isolated; thus, we do not have the chance for potential secondary outbreaks, although it is not difficult to introduce this effect.

• The mortality and birth rates are assumed to be 0.

For the initial calculations, we assume that intervention, if it occurs, starts on the 10th day.

When looking at the plots for influenza with intervention, we can estimate the progress of influenza when we assume that the restrictions, similar to those introduced during COVID-19, are implemented on the 10th day from the time of outbreak.

The assumed start time of interventions above was ten days.

Hence, we decided to perform calculations assuming different values of delay.

Upon showing symptoms, individuals using the CTA send notifications to the other CTA users that they are in contact with, who then move to quarantine for a fixed duration of time.

In each of these CTA-uptake scenarios, we assume that individuals in the population will quarantine themselves as soon as their symptoms are sufficiently strong (exceeding a certain threshold).

We assume that a population is embedded in a geometric space, and the connections between individuals are modelled using a random network model called a Geometric Inhomogenous Random Graph (GIRG) [4].

In the case where all contacts are asked to use the CTA, our model assumes that roughly half of these contacts do begin using the CTA.

This makes sense in the context of trying to allocate a limited supply of vaccines, but not in our context—it is reasonable to assume that anyone recommending the app to a friend will also install it themselves.

The experiments in Fig 2assumed an epidemic model (see Section 2) with a low rate of infection β =0.05.

In our model, we assume that there is an underlying probability distribution that determines whether an individual would be symptomatic, in the case that this individual is infected, and also that there is an underlying probability distribution determining the severity of these symptoms.

Recall that we work under the assumption that either a single virus is present in the population (so all relevant symptoms are caused by this virus) or testing is immediate and available to those who exceed the symptom severity threshold. This assumption is important for the results in this section.

The experiments in Fig 8 assumed an epidemic model (see Fig 2) with a low rate of infection β =0.05.

The assumption that we do we make, however, is that each individual has an independent symptom-strength variable, making Vsev a random set of nodes.

We assume that they self-quarantine until being removed.

Nodes in the N-states and in state (Se) are assumed to be self-quarantining, so they cannot spread infection.

seem reasonable given current data, it is possible that viral

We assumed that an individual is infectious during the time period that their Ct value is less than 30.

We assumed individuals are uniformly infectious during this period of Ct less than 30.

We assumed that 1 day after symptom onset, they seek out and have a PCR test that is returned positive, which begins the process of contact 
tracing. Based on the latest National Health Service test and trace data, we assumed that it takes a delay of 3 days from the sample being taken to contacts being instructed to quarantine. 

We assumed that all contacts are successfully identified and traced and, that once traced, are subject to one of several strategies designed to avert onward transmission. 

However, if the end-of-quarantine test is scheduled to occur before 
the time of the secondary case’s tracing, we assumed that they are tested as soon as they are traced; hence, a 0-day quarantine with a test will be equivalent to an immediate test and release strategy.

For PCR, we assumed that the probability of detection is 100% for Ct below 35 and 0% above 35

As a moderate baseline scenario, we assumed that 50% of individuals adhere to quarantine and 67% adhere to self-isolation guidelines.

We assumed adherence as a binary variable (adhering or not-adhering) for each individual by sampling from a Bernoulli distribution with the probability given by the proportion adhering.

Assuming that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is driven by superspreading events, we report the uncertainty associated with the 
average secondary transmission potential averted per superspreading event by simulating 1000 index cases with ten secondary cases.

We found that if rates of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation can be boosted, substantial increases in effect over that of the baseline 14-day quarantine policy might be achieved, assuming that in the baseline scenario, 50% of individuals adhere to quarantine and 67% of individuals adhere to post-symptom or post-positive test self-isolation (figure 4; appendix p 3). 

Hence, we assumed a higher, moderate baseline of 50% of individuals fully adhering to quarantine (and therefore having their transmission potential reduced to zero), which we assumed increased to 67% for self-isolation after symptom onset or a positive test, which might better reflect the rate of public involvement in contact tracing.

Investigating this assumption in our modelling, we found that raised adherence increases the benefit of both short quarantines with testing (at the end of quarantine) and daily testing, beyond that of the current 14-day quarantine.

One of the simplifying assumptions we have made is that the Ct curve is a reasonable proxy for both probability of detection by testing (with both PCR and LFA) and potential for transmission. 

Our study has several limitations. In this analysis, we have focused on the potential for quarantine and testing to reduce the transmission potential of traced secondary infections and have not evaluated the number, and cost, of tests that might be required, nor the possibility of false positives, which—despite the high specificity of PCR and 
LFA—might arise in mass testing of asymptomatic individuals.

Assuming that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is driven by superspreading events,19 we report the uncertainty associated with the average secondary transmission potential averted per superspreading event by simulating 1000 index cases with ten secondary cases. We calculated the median and inner 50% and 95% ranges for the sum of the secondary cases’ infectious periods spent in quarantine or self-isolation divided by the sum of secondary cases’ infectious periods if there were no quarantine or self-isolation requirements. Because the model considers averting this transmission rather than focusing on the generation of additional cases, the average amount of infectivity in secondary cases averted by quarantine or testing, or both, is independent of the number of additional cases generated, and the choice of the number of secondary cases affects the width of the uncertainty intervals (UIs; here we consider a reasonable upper bound on secondary cases based on superspreading, as mentioned, in an attempt to faithfully characterise real-world uncertainty).

As such, we have provided a sensitivity analysis using the lower reported sensitivities of LFA in the Liverpool Mass Testing Pilot18 and discussion of results in the context of other studies (appendix p 4).

Text:
The results show that initial strategy of the community with strict supervision and reasonable government reward allocation will increase the proportion of the residents complying with the quarantine rule. When 80% of the communities chose to supervise strictly at the beginning, people are more likely to follow the rules. While when the residents can only get 20% of the government’s reward, the proportion of choosing to violate the quarantine rules is much higher than that when they can get 80% of the reward

Secondly, a two-layer complex coupling network is established to simulate the evolutionary behavior and learning mechanism of the two-game players, community and residents, from a micro perspective, and the effectiveness of epidemic prevention policies was fitted from multiple perspectives.

For the community, actively monitoring includes taking regular temperature measurement, timely reporting, real-time supervision, etc., which costs labor, material, financial, and time. These costs are recorded as C. The residents will also afford a certain amount of time and money due to the inability to go out, work, or associate with others under the requirements of home quarantine, which is recorded as a

When the residents violate the rules, they shall be imposed a fine or other punishments according to the law in China, and this penalty amount is recorded as b. Only when the community chooses active supervision people who violate the rules will be punished at the cost of b with a certain probability q (qb > a), q denotes the possibility that their misbehavior is discovered by the local community. At the same time, a violation of the quarantine rules will cause the expansion of the spread of the epidemic with the probability of p, which will have a negative impact on society. We let V denote the loss of social benefits, which is suffered by the community, then the loss of the community is recognized as pV.

Each node in the G1 network plays a game with its neighbor nodes in the G2 network, and counts its own payoff. Therefore, the total payoff of the node after a round of the game is counted as follows:

Therefore, based on the perspective of the game relationships between the community and the quarantined residents on a double-layer complex network, this paper analyses the impact of the implementation of the quarantine rules under the different strategic choices of the two parties, explores the evolutionary behavior and learning mechanism of the two game subjects of the community and the residents, and simulates evolution mechanism in the conditions of different parameters using Agent-Based Modeling(ABM) method

The relationship between two groups of the community and the residents is supervision and supervised, namely the local community supervises residents who need to be quarantined and residents are supervised by the local community. And the relationship within each group is the general homogeneity relationship, which means they can learn from each other’s strategies.

On the other hand, when k is very small, for example, close to 0, the value of W will be close to 1, indicating that external factors will not interfere with the learning strategy of the node, and there is a high probability that the node will imitate its neighbors.

It shows that when the environmental noise becomes larger, the residents are more likely to be affected by various information in the surrounding environment rather than choose strategies in the next round based on the difference between their payoffs and those of their neighbors, thus changing their original choices of choosing the strategy.

(2) Learning After a round of the game, community nodes in the upper network will randomly select a neighboring node of the same network to compare their payoffs, so will residents nodes in the lower network. There is a certain probability for each node to decide whether to learn the neighbor’s strategy to change its own strategy in this round. This article adopts Fermi rule [19] as the strategy updating rule: Wi = 1 1+e ( Ui1−Ui2 k ) (3) where Wi represents the probability that the individual i1 learns from the strategy of one of its neighbors in the G1 network, Ui1 and Ui2 respectively represent their payoffs, and k depicts the noise effect, which indicates that individuals may make irrational choices [20]. Similarly, the probability that individual j1 in the G2 network learns from the same-level neighbor is: Wj = 1 1+e ( Uj1−Uj2 k ) (4)

This paper explores the evolutionary equilibrium from a macro perspective through the replication dynamic method, then uses the ABM method, basing on complex networks and individual learning strategies according to the real interaction among agents, and analyze the topology of the small world network and reveal the evolution process of the residents and community strategic selections under the double-layer network from a microscopic perspective of view.",No,,Yes,"At this time, because the epidemic is effectively controlled, the community and the residents will jointly receive a government reward of E.

Only when the community chooses active supervision, people who violate the rules will be punished at the cost of b with a certain probability q (qb > a), q denotes the possibility that their misbehavior is discovered by the local community.

In this situation, if people choose to comply with the rules, then their cost is still a; if they choose to violate, it will cause the epidemic to spread widely with the probability p, thus causing loss to the community at the cost of pV, while there is no punishment for them due to the community’s inaction.

Hypothesis 1: Both communities and residents are bounded rationality, they choose strategies according to their expected return, and there is a certain probability that the optimal strategy is not selected by two parties;

Each node participating in the game may adjust its strategy selection at time t according to the comparison of the payoff of its neighbors and its own at time t-1.

And the relationship within each group is the general homogeneity relationship, which means they can learn from each other’s strategies.

On the other hand, when k is very small, for example, close to 0, the value of W will be close to 1, indicating that external factors will not interfere with the learning strategy of the node, and there is a high probability that the node will imitate its neighbors.

It shows that when the environmental noise becomes larger, the residents are more likely to be affected by various information in the surrounding environment rather than choose strategies in the next round based on the difference between their payoffs and those of their neighbors, thus changing their original choices of choosing the strategy.

In the calibration process we fitted the model generated epidemic estimates to the UK epidemic metrics, by performing an automated search for the optimal values of (a) the number of infected people on January 21, 2020, (b) the average per-contact transmission probability across layers, which is then subsequently scaled by layer (c) the daily testing probabilities for symptomatic individuals (𝑝𝑠) over November 2020 -January 2021, and (d) the 3 parameters associated with the modelled logistic curve of the alpha variant strain (number of cases on September 20, 2021, slope of the infectiousness curve and time when saturation is achieved). We used the Optuna optimisation methodology (https://optuna.org) to search the hyperparameters space for optimal values of these parameters that minimised the sum of squared differences between the model’s estimates of cumulative diagnoses, cumulative deaths and cumulative hospital admissions, and data on these same three indicators between January 21, 2020 and January 25, 2021 collated from the UK government’s COVID-19 dashboard (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk).

The level of reduction in transmission in households, workplaces and community that we modelled was informed by Google mobility data [23]. Specifically, for the household transmission we modelled increased transmission since November 2020 of 25% and in line with the average monthly level of increased household mobility in the Google data [23]. For the workplaces and community, during the November lockdown, we also used Google mobility data to obtain a broad range of the change, but we also needed to adjust these during the calibration process.

We also used publicly available weekly data from NHS Test and Trace to estimate the rate of tracing of contacts of those testing positive since the start of the programme on May 28, 2020 [24].

We also assumed that asymptomatic testing is available across all society layers and modelled this in line with reported numbers in the UK (0.076% May-August 2020, 0.28% August-October 2020 and 0.63% since November 2020 from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirustesting).",,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions,"As with any modelling study, we have made a number of assumptions when simulating the epidemic.

Under this assumption, we modelled the contribution from the dominating strain to induce larger infectiousness.

Thirdly, we did not use regional variations in cases, R value or the proportion of alpha presence.

581,Coffeng 2022,Predicting epidemics and the impact of interventions in heterogeneous settings: Standard SEIR models are too pessimistic,Consensus,No,,Understanding the role of ___,Contact or social network structure,No,,No,,Considered and imposed,"Let us assume we have estimated the transmission rate given some initial exponential growth (as in Figure 1), and let us now predict the impact of an intervention that reduces all individuals’ transmission rates by 50% for the remainder of the epidemic (Figure 2).",General preventative behavior,"Let us assume we have estimated the transmission rate given some initial exponential growth (as in Figure 1), and let us now predict the impact of an intervention that reduces all individuals’ transmission rates by 50% for the remainder of the epidemic (Figure 2).",No,,,,,,,,,,,,No,virsim R package,No,,Assumptions,"Assumptions (assume)
Using stochastic simulations with a geographically stratified individual-based SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model, we illustrate that if heterogeneity is ignored (i.e. no or too little assumed interindividual variation or assortative mixing) this may substantially overestimate the transmission rate and the potential course of the epidemic.

However, should such an intervention be suspended, then the potential for a consecutive epidemic wave will depend strongly on assumptions about heterogeneity, with more heterogeneity resulting in lower remaining epidemic potential, due to selection and depletion of high-risk individuals during the early stages of the epidemic.

Let us assume that this initial exponential growth (period between the two black bullets in Figure 1) is well described by a model for a homogeneously mixing population of 10,000 people with a transmission rate of 0.5 day−1, meaning that R0 = 5 × 0.5 = 2.5 (red line). To reproduce the same initial exponential growth with a model that allows for interindividual variation in contact rates (assuming a gamma distribution with shape 3.4), the average transmission rate has to be lower: about 0.395 day−1 (green line).

This pattern is slightly more pronounced when we consider assortative mixing (blue line), where people are assumed to interact more with people who have similar contact rates. Here we assume that individual contact rates vary as in the second model variant, but the population is divided in 10 clusters (e.g. villages or neighbourhoods) of 1000 individuals each, and individuals spend 90% of their time in their own cluster and 10% in the population as a whole, and cluster membership is correlated with an individual’s contact rate (𝜗 = 0.26, in contrast to 𝜗 = 0 for the first two model variants) (de Vlas & Coffeng, 2021).

More noticeable, however, is that the size of the epidemic decreases substantially with increasing assumed levels of heterogeneity, because more high-risk individuals have been ‘spent’ by the epidemic, leaving the rest of the population to support transmission at a slower rate (Figure 1).

It also means that when using IBMs, one should be very careful when adopting estimates of transmission rates from other models or when deriving such transmission rates from estimates of R0 based on other models, which may have relied on other assumptions regarding heterogeneity in transmission. A second potential pitfall relates to predicting the impact of an intervention with some known or assumed effect on transmission. Let us assume we have estimated the transmission rate given some initial exponential growth (as in Figure 1), and let us now predict the impact of an intervention that reduces all individuals’ transmission rates by 50% for the remainder of the epidemic (Figure 2).

Where the homogeneous model shows a small peak (red), this peak is lower and narrower for a model with interindividual variation in contact rates (green), and completely absent in the model with assortative mixing (blue), barring the rise in case numbers around 5 days after implementation of the intervention, which is due to the assumed latency time of infection being 4.6 days. This phenomenon highlights that model predictions for the impact of interventions with some known or assumed effect are also more pessimistic when heterogeneity in transmission is not sufficiently captured.

Let us then recalibrate the transmission rate and intervention effect for each of the three models, using approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo (Toni et al., 2009)(https://gitlab.com/ luccoffeng/abcsmc), assuming the same three quantifications of heterogeneity as before (homogenous mixing, heterogeneous mixing and assortative mixing).

The estimated effect of the intervention was a 51% reduction (95%-BCI: 39–59%) in the average transmission rate for the homogeneous model (red), or a 49% reduction (95%-BCI: 39%–61%) when assuming interindividual variation (green), and a 46% reduction (95%-BCI: 31%–60%) when assuming assortative mixing.

Now, if we project the impact of these interventions forward in time, assuming that these interventions are continued indefinitely (solid lines in Figure 3), our three alternative assumptions about heterogeneity result in qualitatively rather similar predictions that would have the same implications for policy: this intervention is effective at controlling the epidemic, taking in the order of 5–6 months. If we consider the possibility of fully lifting interventions when a target prevalence of, say, 100 prevalent infectious cases has been reached (dashed lines in Figure 3), our three alternative assumptions about heterogeneity result in distinctly different outcomes that have completely different implications for public health: a pronounced second wave that might cause problems for health care (homogeneous model, red); a smaller, more ‘manageable’ second wave (interindividual variation, green); or an even gentler second wave (assortative mixing, blue). Even with additional data on the decline in infection numbers after the first peak, it would be almost impossible to distinguish which of the three alternative assumptions is most plausible.

However, should such an intervention be suspended, say, after reaching a target, the potential for a second epidemic wave will depend strongly on assumptions about heterogeneity, with more heterogeneity resulting in lower remaining epidemic potential, due to selection and depletion of high-risk individuals during the early stages of the epidemic.

Underlying modelling assumptions and average transmission rates are as in Figure 1.

For the scenario with interindividual variation (green), individual transmission rates were assumed to follow a Gamma distribution with shape 3.4, such that the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution differed by a factor 10. For assortative mixing (blue), we assumed that the population was divided into 10 clusters, where individuals experienced 90% of the force of infection from within their own cluster and 10% from the population as a whole, with individual cluster membership being correlated with an individual’s contact rate (𝜗 = 0.26)",Yes,https://gitlab.com/luccoffeng/rss-discussion-jrssa-paper-SEIR-pessimistic,No,"We illustrate this by means of a simulation study with an individual-based SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model implemented in R package virsim (www.gitlab.com/luccoffeng/virsim), which was recently used to explore the impact of a geographically stratified strategy against COVID-19 (de Vlas & Coffeng, 2021).

Let us then recalibrate the transmission rate and intervention effect for each of the three models, using approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo (Toni et al., 2009) (https://gitlab.com/ luccoffeng/abcsmc), assuming the same three quantifications of heterogeneity as before (homogenous mixing, heterogeneous mixing and assortative mixing).",One discipline,Life Sciences,Health Sciences,"Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands",No,,Calibration,"Let us then recalibrate the transmission rate and intervention effect for each of the three models, using approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo (Toni et al., 2009)(https://gitlab.com/ luccoffeng/abcsmc), assuming the same three quantifications of heterogeneity as before (homogenous mixing, heterogeneous mixing and assortative mixing).

For each scenario (coloured lines), the overall transmission rate in the population was calibrated such that the initial exponential growth (from 100 to 500 cumulative cases (i.e. up to 5% of the population), indicated by the black bullets), averaged over repeated simulations, matched that of a simple homogeneously mixing model with R0 = 2.5 (red line).",Yes,"These ‘data’ were based on the average of 500 repeated simulation with the homogeneously mixing model with a fixed parameter set as in Figure 2.

virus material is shed as aerosol [54].

One could, for example, assume that the windows are opened once per hour, and all of the air is replaced with outside air. This would correspond to an air exchange rate of 1/h. If one assumes a constant rate of virus emission, there would be a linear increase of concentration up to the opening of the window, after which the virus concentration in the air would quickly go towards zero. 

Since the infection seeds are initiated into our model with the status exposed (cf. Fig 3) and it can be assumed that the reporting date is significantly after the exposure date, we date the data from RKI back by one week.

Since we assume underreporting in the RKI numbers, we multiply them by 4; this is discussed in Sec. Under-reporting, and its variation over time. 

This means that the model assumes that, say for a 50% work reduction, there will be a different 50% subset of persons at work every day.

We assume that an encounter outdoors decreases the infection probability by one magnitude [54, 79]. 

We have assumed that other leisure activities (e.g. restaurants, visit friends) behave similarly. 

They are plausible under the assumption that the fraction of people

If that translation was known, one could attempt to calibrate the model from first principles. Practically, we use Θ as our main calibration parameter.

Time-dependent inputs and calibration section

Calibration The calibration procedure undertaken for the present paper is described in the following sections. Calibration is performed by visual comparison, with first priority against the time series of the number of hospital patients in Berlin, and with second priority against the COVID case numbers in Berlin. The calibration procedure, as described in the following, isas much about which elements to include at all as about finding the right parameters. “Second priority” here means that if calibration against hospital numbers is undecided between two alternatives, then the case numbers are used in addition. The case numbers are only used with second priority since the screening procedure has been changed multiple times, which means that the resulting time series is not homogeneous and thus not useful for model calibration.

A formal calibration of Θ can be found in Sec. Out of sample prediction. The calibration includes the following elements: 1. Calibration of the basic doubling time without reduction of activity participation 2. Integration of spring disease import 3. Calibration of the consequences of reduced activity participation 4. Calibration of an indoors/outdoors effect for leisure activities depending on the temperature 5. Integration of contact tracing, masks, and summer disease import All calibrations concern Θ (cf. Eq 1); item 4also involves defining threshold temperatures at which activities are moved outdoors at the end of the winter, and indoors at the end of the summer.

From Fig 11 one takes away that a good calibration with the elements described so far would be possible, with a theta Factor between 0.6 and 0.8.

We show the predictive performance of our model by calibrating the simulation on a fixed training set and comparing simulation results into the future against unused data. In this calibration Θ is calibrated such that the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) between hospital cases in the simulation compared to historic data is minimized.

We run this calibration up to various dates. From there on, we perform two types of prediction: (a) Fig 17 left: With activity participation levels frozen at the level of the last calibration day (see the second column of Table 3; only during school vacations are school and work activities reduced for prediction dates); (b) Fig 17 right: With activity levels as given from the data also for prediction dates.

One finds that the correct activity level (Fig 17 right) is crucial especially for longer-term predictions: Even with calibration only to the end of April, the model predicts the autumn wave very well, while when the activity numbers are frozen (Fig 17 left), the forecasts have a drift depending on whether the activity level is too low or too high on the day when it is frozen.

In consequence, these sub-models need to be understood and re-calibrated for each individual communicable disease.

The importance of the temperature effect can best be taken from the calibration sequence: Fig 6showing that a Θ smaller than 0.6 is not plausible; Fig 8showing that reduced activity participation alone is not able to bring infections and resulting hospital levels down to the observed level during summer; Fig 10 showing that asymmetric indoors/outdoors model is able to achieve that but misses the fall wave; and finally Fig 11 showing that the asymmetric indoors/outdoors model, with a significantly higher threshold temperature at the end of the summer, is able to also generate the fall wave.

In second order, the calibration parameter Θ would have to get increased to bring infections back to the previous level.

In terms of calibration, the initial growth is, within limits, insensitive against changes of Θ, since it is dominated by the disease import.

It is validated against the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany).",Yes,"For this, the simulation is run with eight different Monte Carlo seeds and then the results are averaged.

 In order to reflect contact tracing and quarantine interventions, exposed commuters who are traced move to the exposed quarantine compartment according to the percentage and the delay of tracing [75]. After the incubation period is over, exposed commuters can be either asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infectious. Asymptomatic infectious commuters continue to daily commute and may infect other co-riders. After a certain period (IPp), pre-symptomatic infectious commuters will develop symptoms and become symptomatic (for the sake of simplification, we do not differentiate between mild, medium, and severe symptoms). Symptomatic commuters can be isolated depending on the percentage and delay of tests (Figure 3).

Therefore, if a subject is infected without showing symptoms, then he/she is not compelled for self-isolation and he/she may use the commuting service carrying the virus and is therefore prone to spreading the disease to the co-riders. Scenario 2: Contact Tracing and Quarantine Similarly to scenario 1, in this scenario 10 infected commuters are introduced in the population on the first day of the simulation (at the same locations).

For both scenarios, we simulated the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 over the total population of riders considering three ridesharing schemes: 1. Trip-based vanpooling, where pools of riders are formed for every trip. 2.

As determined by the initial sensitivity analysis, vaccine effectiveness is quite sensitive to the number of available doses, the maximum post-
dose two efficacy, and the efficacy of the first dose relative to the
second.

In our sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Fig. 11), we find that even in “older” countries like the UK, an infection blocking vaccine could reshape the parameter space where a double dose strategy is optimal

Although vaccine efficacy was explored in the sensitivity analyses presented here, we centered the explored ranges around the point estimates presented in ref. 19.


Throughout this paper, we present a sensitivity analysis of the post-dose two maximum efficacy, the relative efficacy of dose one vs dose two, and the booster dose interval.

In a separate sensitivity analysis, we explore how the results presented in the main text are sensitive to vaccine indirect effects on transmission.",Yes,"The sensitivity of the modeled vaccine effectiveness to the variables explored is illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure illustrates that the prospects for vaccine impact are most sensitive to the number of vaccine doses available within 6 months, the speed of delivery within the same timeframe, and the vaccine efficacy (both the maximum efficacy post-dose two and the relative efficacy of dose one compared with dose two). Interestingly, for the same inputs, the median expected vaccine effectiveness is greater for deaths than it is for clinical cases.

These threshold allocation lines are generally robust to assumptions on vaccine indirect effects on transmission, especially for the most realistic range of a dose two efficacy boosting effect (0.7–0.8)19 as shown in Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11.

The thresholds considered in this work will differ depending on country contexts and vaccine efficacy related parameters. We have included the potential impact of age structures and dose availability on the policy implications of different vaccine schedules but should emphasize that further research on specific epidemiological and health system contexts, especially in LMICs, is needed. In particular, the relative proportion of high-risk groups versus high-incidence groups, familial structures, mixing patterns between high-risk and high-incidence groups, vaccine access equity across risk groups, and vaccine regulatory processes leading to approval and recommendation, stand out as critical elements.

Published clinical data were used to inform the parameters used in the model described in this paper. These data provide an aggregate efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among people of a wide range of ages living in different countries. However, there were limited data available for assessing the effects of certain parameters (such as the effect of the dosing interval on post-dose two or dose three efficacy) on vaccine efficacy, which reinforces the need to conduct the post hoc exploratory analysis presented here.

However, the limited availability of resources, and specific country contexts, may require decision-makers to consider alternative strategies.

Here, we decided to simplify the transmission process by making the daily risk of infection constant over time, thus having a static transmission model. Initially, we performed a calibration process whereby we ran the model without vaccination thousands of times, each time assuming a different daily risk of infection parameter. We then selected those parameter values that gave us the desired attack rates over a 6-month period as specified in Table 1. By attack rate we mean the proportion of the population that is newly infected during those 6 months.

Although vaccine efficacy was explored in the sensitivity analyses presented here, we centered the explored ranges around the point estimates presented in ref. 19.

To reflect how the network of effective infectious contacts includes different proportions of vaccinated people each day, we assume that the mean impact on transmission changes daily.

To validate the model performance, reverse engineering was performed weekly between March 2 and July 1, 2020.

The hybrid model (ABM + SD) enabled us to validate results performance for each run.

The analysis comprises two main components: model validation using reverse engineering and measurement of the impact of NPIs.

The model validation reported primarily on four outcomes: • Total cases: number of infectious cases (including recovered, mortality, and active infectious cases) from day 0 to a specified day • Active cases: number of active infectious cases on a specified day. Active Cases = Total cases (Recovered + Mortality) • ICU cases: number of active infectious cases that were admitted to the ICU because of Covid-19 on a specified day • Death cases: number of mortality cases because of COVID-19 from day 0 to a specified day To validate the model percentage difference, all four outcomes are calculated.

We calibrated the model to reproduce the reported community surveillance incidence in primary school students (6–10years old) in 
France in January 2022 [3], and considered additional scenarios of Omicron waves reaching lower and higher peaks to capture the variability of the wave across European countries [2]. 

Omicron’s higher spreading rate was considered to be mainly due to 
immune evasion [20], in line with observations from household studies [22], but we also tested a transmissibility advantage of 80% relative to Delta for sensitivity (Supplemental Table S1. Parameters, values and 
sources used to define the compartmental model).


Students with positive tests had to isolate for 7days. For sensitivity, we tested reactive screening with different numbers and lags for control (D0, D3, D7 and D0, D4, see Supplement 4.5. Sensitivity analysis on control screening)


The model was informed with time-varying and age-dependent test sensitivity, yielding an estimated 67% peak sensitivity for asymptomatic children in nasal LFD tests and 96% in salivary PCR tests [26] (Supplement 1.5.

This analysis, performed for different variants, may prove extremely useful for regional and national authorities ahead of the subsequent season of disease incidence.

The model we have developed, based on the use of ABM, can be a highly useful tool for determining the probability of infection transmission in a given region and an information resource for authorities who need to introduce specific restrictions to prevent virus transmission. Moreover, the model and its four model variations are flexible, and it is possible to adapt them to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However, thanks to the model’s general nature, it is possible to perform analogous simulations for a period in which a significant (and spatially varying) percentage of the population has been vaccinated.

The implemented model assumes that the following factors strongly correlate with disease transmission: • the spatial distribution of the population—because the agents are spatially distributed, and the infection arises from close contact between the infected and the exposed individual; • the residents’ level of mobility—because the level of mobility may affect the number of encounters between one agent and another (potentially infected) individual; • the characteristics of the restrictions imposed (and the compliance level)—because the model considers the extent of the restrictions, e.g., obligatory mask usage (whether an infected and exposed individual affects the likelihood of infection), compulsory remote work or education, and stay-at-home requirements affect the agent’s mobility;
",Stay at home; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Practice good hygiene,"school closings, workspace closings, public event cancelations
The indicators used to calculate the index are (C1) school closings, (C2) workspace closings, (C3) public event cancelations, (C4) gathering restrictions, (C5) public transportation closings, (C6) stay at home requirements, (C7) internal movement restrictions, (C8) international travel controls, (H1) public information campaigns, (H2) testing policies, (H3) contact tracing, (H6) facial covering policies, and (H7) vaccination policies.

Epidemiological data collected by powiat sanitary and epidemiological stations and made available by the Information Systems Division of the Analysis and Strategy Department of the Ministry of Health19 was used to calibrate the model and evaluate the results.",,,,,,,,,,,Yes,GAMA,No,,Assumptions,"Assumptions (assume)
The assumption is that each agent has a set of demographic and social characteristics, spatial location, and infection status (according to the SEIAPR-DM model).

The ABM methodology assumes the simulation of agents’ behaviors in a specific environment, understood as a spatial reference at the level of particular powiats.

The model assumes that each agent has one of the following states: immune, susceptible, exposed, infected and symptomatic, infected but asymptomatic, positively diagnosed, or dead.

The experiments assumed 15-min intervals between simulations.

The basic model does not assume limitation of the development of a pandemic through vaccination but facilitates examination of the impact of individual topographic, demographic, and social factors and the imposed restrictions on the pace of pandemic development in particular regions.

The implemented model assumes that the following factors strongly correlate with disease transmission: • the spatial distribution of the population—because the agents are spatially distributed, and the infection arises from close contact between the infected and the exposed individual; • the residents’ level of mobility—because the level of mobility may affect the number of encounters between one agent and another (potentially infected) individual; • the characteristics of the restrictions imposed (and the compliance level)—because the model considers the extent of the restrictions, e.g., obligatory mask usage (whether an infected and exposed individual affects the likelihood of infection), compulsory remote work or education, and stay-at-home requirements affect the agent’s mobility; • weather conditions—as the probability of infection depends on the humidity and temperature of the actual day; • the local community’s specificity—because the characteristics of the local community, such as the unemployment rate, the number of people working outside their place of residence (town, commune, powiat), or religiosity, affect the community’s mobility, which should result in a diversified development of infections

For instance, it was assumed that 90% of primary school students attended the school closest to their place of residence, which enabled geospatial analyses using Voronoi diagrams and digital linking of individual agents with places of residence, work, study, rest, medical care, and shopping.

Since each of these parameters may affect the accuracy of calculations in various ways, it was necessary to recalibrate the model for each powiat using source epidemiological data. As an objective function during calibration, we assumed the minimization of the difference between the number of infected according to the real data and the model’s result after 1 month of simulation. During the calibration, the assumption was that the only variable of the objective function would be the probability coefficient of infection during agent interaction.",Yes,https://github.com/piotrpowerpalka/Covid-19-ABM/tree/PPbranch,Yes,"The model of the agents’ movement is based on21,22.

",Yes,The article’s authors presented their results to the Polish Ministry of Health several times. The results have played a part in modifying the approach to counteracting the development of subsequent phases of the pandemic by utilizing spatial and demographic differentiation of the country and taking measures appropriate to the local conditions.,Verification; Calibration,"Epidemiological data collected by powiat sanitary and epidemiological stations and made available by the Information Systems Division of the Analysis and Strategy Department of the Ministry of Health19 was used to calibrate the model and evaluate the results.

To ensure the credibility of the research, the base case model was calibrated independently for all three test powiats based on sanitary and epidemiological data of the number of cases on individual days.

Since each of these parameters may affect the accuracy of calculations in various ways, it was necessary to recalibrate the model for each powiat using source epidemiological data. As an objective function during calibration, we assumed the minimization of the difference between the number of infected according to the real data and the model’s result after 1 month of simulation. During the calibration, the assumption was that the only variable of the objective function would be the probability coefficient of infection during agent interaction.

Due to the model’s high computational complexity, the calibration process was nontrivial; thus, the researchers did not choose complete automation of the process. The probability coefficient of infection during agent contact was calibrated. Because of the nature of the model, this coefficient required only minor adjustments to calibrate to actual data. However, depending on the powiat, the calibration process took several days to 2 weeks.

The use of reliable topographic, demographic, social, and sanitary and epidemiological data makes it possible to calibrate the base case model at a level of error equal to 1%, enabling reliable what-if analyses that utilize alternative models.

This model was calibrated based on data from March 2020 to January 2021 (after this date, Poland began mass vaccinations, which significantly influenced the model). The verification of the model’s operation shows that considering the characteristics of individual powiats, such as population distribution, mobility level, development layout, type of public transportation, and the introduced level of restrictions, facilitates a reliable forecast of the number of cases at the level of 2%. It is possible to use this model for research purposes and verification of what-if hypotheses.

Such an approach enables the analysis of the spatial differentiation of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and the verification of research hypotheses indicating the crucial role of restrictive policies.
",Yes,"This type of simulation is very accurate and supported by carefully selected parameters derived from the literature or relevant institutions.

A wide range of nonspatial data were also used to parameterize the rules characterizing individual powiats, including data on territorial collectivities, considering development mechanisms at the local or regional level. The authors decided on methods such as desk research and secondary statistical analysis.

The verification of the model’s operation shows that considering the characteristics of individual powiats, such as population distribution, mobility level, development layout, type of public transportation, and the introduced level of restrictions, facilitates a reliable forecast of the number of cases at the level of 2%.

To ensure the credibility of the research, the base case model was calibrated independently for all three test powiats based on sanitary and epidemiological data of the number of cases on individual days. !e proposed model has many parameters set individually for each powiat, for instance, housing and population density, the residents’ level of mobility, and the level of public transport use. Since each of these parameters may affect the accuracy of calculations in various ways, it was necessary to recalibrate the model for each powiat using source epidemiological data.

For the Go&dap powiat, the accuracy (MPE error) was 1.64%; for Ropczyce-Sdziszów, the accuracy was 0.68%; and for Pruszków, the accuracy was 0.64%. Due to the model’s high computational complexity, the cali bration process was nontrivial; thus, the researchers did not choose complete automation of the process. !e probability coe cient of infection during agent contact was calibrated. Because of the nature of the model, this coefficient required only minor adjustments to calibrate to actual data.

Tables%3, 4 and Figs.%5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 present the numerical results obtained by the multiagent model, while Figs.%6, 8 and 10 show the spatial distribution of the number of cases, their locations, and differences between individual models

It should be stressed that the spatial interpretation of the obtained results required complex SQL querying of the database with spatial operators. To highlight various aspects of the obtained results for individual models, the authors provide a summary for entire powiats, gminas constituting powiats, and 1 km2 units, as used in the o cial statistics. Additionally, to analyze the spatial relationship between individual parameters, e.g., the number of people living in a given region and the number of cases in this area, the authors used proprietary tools to determine the Pearson correlation coefficient in a moving (circular) window of a given size. !e authors obtained discrete results (e.g., point information on the percentage of incidence in a 1 km2 area) and interpolated them to show a continuous statistical surface illustrating the spatial distribution of individual phenomena (Figs.%6, 8 and 10).

The location of cases (black dots) and the density of cases by place of infection: the no restrictions model. (g) The Pearson correlation coefficient between the place of infection and the number of inhabitants in the area (white < 0.5, yellow < 0.75, red , 0.75): the base case model. (h) The Pearson correlation coefficient between the place of infection and the number of inhabitants in the area (white < 0.5, yellow < 0.75, red , 0.75): the no restrictions model (developed by the authors in QGIS ver. 3.22.5)

!e obtained point values (discrete) are then interpolated to a continuous statistical surface. White indicates no correlation, yellow indicates a weak linear correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.5), and red indicates a strong correlation (correlation coefficient > 0.75). the strongest spatial correlations occur in densely populated areas where many people fall ill. When analyzing the obtained results, the level of spatial generalization of the results should be considered; each dot on the map represents a value assigned to its circular surroundings with a radius of 2500%m (nearly 20 km2).

Ensuring reliable results requires effective modeling methods and reliable source data that allow system calibration. The use of multiagent modeling systems enables complete parameterization of the modeling process.

The use of reliable topographic, demographic, social, and sanitary and epidemiological data makes it possible to calibrate the base case model at a level of error equal to 1%, enabling reliable what-if analyses that utilize alternative models.

Due to the use of topographic, demographic, sanitary and epidemiological data, the reliability of the obtained results is satisfactory.

We consider four different protocols for what interventions are implemented when students become symptomatic or receive a positive test result

In the whole class protocol, when a symptomatic student receives a positive test result, all students are isolated and further transmission is prevented.",Stay at home; Get tested,We consider four different protocols for what interventions are implemented when students become symptomatic or receive a positive test result. In each protocol students who become symptomatic immediately stop attending school and therefore cannot infect other students.,No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions ""assum""

Rather than assuming that all students in the class are equally likely to transmit the infection to each other, we model individual and contact group effects. We assume that the nclass students are broken into smaller groups of ngroup students.

Table 1 lists the parameter values used in our simulations and provides supporting citations. 
We explore the impact of these assumptions in the supplemental material. 

We assume that students are in 5 contact groups of ngroup = 5.

We assume there is no overlap between the morning and afternoon classes except for the index case.

We assume that all symptomatic students are isolating outside the classroom, but whether asymptomatic students are depends on student behaviour, which is influenced by public health guidelines. We use the term policy to indicate the guidelines for student isolation outside the classroom, and its subsequent effect on student behaviour, (whereas we use protocols to refer to what happens in the classroom, as before.) Under a lax policy we assume that asymptomatic or presymptomatic students are not told to isolate (regardless of whether their group or class is shut down), and the number of asymptomatic student-days is just the total number of student-days of infectiousness without symptoms. Under a strict policy we assume that when a group or class is shut down all students in the group are told to isolate until they recover or receive a negative test result. So the asymptomatic student-days under this policy is the total number of days students are infectious but asymptomatic before their group or class is shut down.

Limitations

Our study has some limitations. We have not extended our simulations beyond the classroom (or high school classrooms) to simulate how each cluster may spread outwards via siblings, parents, teachers and their contacts, other household interactions, friendship groups and the broader community. These factors are complex and other models have explored them [47–51], some also finding that extensive testing or successful test and trace systems are required to avoid schools amplifying COVID-19 transmission. We focused instead on how heterogeneity in transmission, arising from individual and environment effects, impacts the ability of mitigation measures to detect and control in-class transmission. We have a simple model of contact in which a known, fixed group of contacts are at highest risk from a given index case. This does not reflect the complex interactions in a classroom setting, but additional mixing or errors in identifying precisely who an index case was in close contact with can be modeled in the same way that we have modeled increased contribution of aerosol transmission (i.e. a risk of transmission outside the identified group of close contacts). There remain many unknowns about the timing and nature of COVID-19 transmission and we have used a simple model with constant infectiousness over time and with variability in the pre-infectious, infectious and symptomatic periods consistent with current knowledge of COVID-19 transmission.

Therefore, every parameter of the simulation is assumed to be a realization of a distribution that can be provided as the input configuration.

Assume S has the L admissible types of attributes and their corresponding probability densities {f1, f2, ..., fL}.

Assume an individual is assigned a profession, e.g., a university professor.

Assume the community C has the set of J subcommunities {S1, S2, ..., SJ}and a J × J connectivity matrix (cij)

Here we assume it has a Beta distribution, i.e., r * Beta (αr, βr) where the hyper-parameters αr, βr are functions of the disease attributes and the social control measures.

This command operates with the idealistic assumption that there is no inaccuracy in detecting infected people.

Thus, the configuration file for the population generator must be designed carefully and based on realistic assumptions.

The immunity parameter is sampled from a distribution that is designed based on this assumption: A person has a negligible immunity against the virus in the first infection, and the immunity is exponentially raised upon each infection.

As opposed to the full quarantine measures, in Fig 13b, we study the effect of quarantine under a more realistic assumption, that is, the detection of the infected people is not absolutely accurate.

Assuming that 20% of the population was protected by vaccination by the end of the summer of 2021, it would be expected that 45% of the population would contract the disease and 0.3% of the population would die.

The factors in the second design were the same, except for the percentage of people protected by vaccination (assuming non transmission after vaccination), which altered according to the percentage of contacts with positives traced (0% or 40%).

As in any model, our results are contingent on the assumptions described, which are more thoroughly discussed by Colomer et al. (2021) [31], including the considerable uncertainties surrounding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 which are being updated almost daily [46–49].

In our model, we assumed that social measures could reduce the probability of virus transmission from infected to non-infected people by 50% because there was no information available on this matter when this study was performed.

Limitations (challenging)
We did not consider potential changes to the virus transmissibility due to environmental factors: in particular, seasonal drivers such as temperature and humidity.

Our model does not include this possibility because the main goal was to disentangle the effects of vaccination and contact tracing to control COVID-19 outbreak at population level where control measures (social distancing, mask wearing and hand hygiene) are or not in operation.

Given that the ratio of campus-to-community population sizes may affect cross-infection results and prevention policies, we assumed three general settings: (1) an urban campus of 10,000 students with 100,000 residents living in the immediately surrounding residential areas or neighborhoods (in which off-campus students tend to reside); (2) a student body of the same size (10,000), but with fewer (40,000) residents living close to the campus; and (3) a smaller number of 2000 students with 40,000 residents living near campus.

Similar results occur assuming the various semester precautions summarized in Table 2, corresponding to plausible reductions in R0 of 25%-50% (Figure 2).

To estimate the impact of school size and location, Figure 4 compares results under other student-to-community population sizes, assuming the same arrival prevalence and campus operation precautions, compliance, and effectiveness scenarios.

Like any model-based analysis, results herein have some limitations and simplifications. A common barrier in such models is data availability for input estimation and results validation (hence our search-based approach). The deterministic ODE modeling framework ignores inherent variability and population heterogeneity [118], motivating our use of Monte Carlo analysis, parameter search replicates, and randomly sampled scenarios. Standard model simplifications include limiting the number of populations (eg, one overall homogenous community population), limiting spread to just SARS-CoV-2 (eg, ignoring seasonal influenza, substance abuse [75,76], and co-epidemic impacts), and not time-varying precaution compliance as concerns and vigilance relax or heighten over time. Some scenarios were also included for potential insights rather than being feasible in practice (eg, 75% reduction in R0, near 100% precaution compliance).",No,,No,,One discipline,Engineering,Civil Engineering,"Healthcare Systems Engineering Institute, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, United States",No,,Calibration; Sensitivity analysis; Validation,"Model Calibration

For community populations, we further calibrated inputs via a particle swarm search algorithm to minimize root mean square error differences between historical and model-predicted infections and mortality, running each parameter search 1000 times

Beyond campus and community reproductive numbers, sensitivity analysis indicated no dominant factors that interventions could primarily target to reduce the magnitude and variability in outcomes, suggesting the importance of comprehensive public health measures and surveillance.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to inform potential effective interventions.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify model inputs to which the mean and variance of results are most sensitive via central composite factorial experimental designs [116] as this could inform policy-making, interventions, and target setting.

Finally, factorial sensitivity analysis produced the relative parameter rankings shown in the two rightmost columns of Table 2, which follow intuition and serve as further model validation.

We developed and validated single and multiple population ordinary differential equations (ODE) and agent-based models of COVID-19 spread within and between defined groups of individuals.

Model accuracy was validated using standard methods [65,78-82], cross-validation, and varied state and county empirical data (January to July 2020) exhibiting different epidemic patterns, magnitudes, and timings (Multimedia Appendix 2).

For campus inputs with uncertainty, we used Monte Carlo simulations to create 1000 synthetic results across plausible ranges, using the shown most likely, maximum, and minimum values to generate asymmetric triangular distribution random variates. Since little data exist about on-campus spread [21], for exposure rates we used the shown ranges for the average number of infected students divided by the exposed-to-infectious percentage

To estimate cross-exposure effects, pairwise differences were computed between each of the 1000 campus results and their campus × community counterparts, and similarly between each of the 1000 community results and their campus × community counterparts. For all model results, medians, standard deviations, and 95% probability intervals were computed, with 10% trimming to reduce any extreme outlier replicate effects"

However, we demonstrate that the contact pattern of the CDD model with short contact times at low velocity makes the virus more likely to spread through a small number of long contacts, which causes strong spatial het erogeneity and low R 0 . Due to the presence of spatial heterogeneity, R 0 will be proportional to the logarithm of the group mobility in the strongly heterogeneous range and saturated in the weakly heterogeneous range, and R 0 is approximately independent of the virulence of the virus when the mobility of the group is low. This demonstrates that in the case of a high reproduc tion number, the vaccination policy and reduced contact time can still significantly inhibit the virus transmission capacity.

We implemented a two-dose vaccination campaign, with a daily vaccination rate that increased over time and saturated at 50doses per dayper10,000 population (Appendix, Figure A2). Vaccination was sequential with prioritization of: (i) healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older (i.e., protection cohort); followed by (ii) individuals aged 16–64 (i.e., disruption minimization cohort) [11,13].

Text:
According to Eq 6, a person’s contagion probability is assumed to increase with the number of present, infected people (ipits ts), the disease contagion rate (β), and the length of exposure (τs); and to decrease with the number of people present (npits ts) in the case of cities, and the degree of confinement the person adopts (κits). Thus, each individual is subject to a different risk depending on the characteristics and state of the municipalities where she spends her day.

Once infected, the model assumes that disease cannot be detected during the first five days; yet, the individual is spreading the disease since the first day. At the beginning of the sixth day, sick patients are sorted between detected (with probability πg) and not detected, and between isolated (with probability πl ) and not isolated. We assume for simplicity that these processes are independent. Patients remain sick for another seven days. Twelve days after contagion (i.e., at the beginning of the thirteenth day), the individual becomes either recovered (and immune afterwards), or dead. The latter, with probability πd–the infection fatality ratio (IFR).",Stay at home,We consider the possibility that a lockdown is decreed for a subset of municipalities. ,Yes,"CMI.

(23 results)

At every moment, the currently present agents at each municipality are assumed to be well-mixed. 

Part-time employed workers do it either in the morning or the afternoon shift; we assume that half of the part-time workers work at each shift. 

Once infected, the model assumes that disease cannot be detected during the first five days; yet, the individual is spreading the disease since the first day. At the beginning of the sixth day, sick patients are sorted between detected (with probability πg) and not detected, and between isolated (with probability πl) and not isolated. We assume for simplicity that these processes are independent. 

Consumption is assumed to take place at the municipality of residence

We assume that by default, when a municipality is locked down (a policy that includes both, restrictions to economic activity and “stay-at-home” rules), people who stay at home are under soft confinement. The exceptions are the elder (over 75 years old, when they are under mandatory confinement by age), and the group of highly educated, over 50 years old who are assumed to self-confine at the end of March. In these latter cases, the agents remain strictly confined at home from the beginning of their (mandatory or self-imposed) confinement, regardless of spatial targeted lockdowns.

Some of our assumptions, in particular the lack of mobility types other than labor, make it difficult to compare the calibrated values of β and πl with available empirical estimations.

On the other hand, we assumed
a constant probability of detection during the entire simulated time window and through all the spatial units, even though there was considerable variation in testing intensity across them.

Limitations

A complete evaluation of the alternative policy options should consider the full duration of the event. We do not attempt such analysis because of the many uncertainties surrounding the epidemic (e.g., the development, distribution, and effectiveness of the vaccines, and the array of strands of the virus that are likely to emerge), and because our model is intended to capture only short-term economic effects (on this regard, see the discussion of limitations below). 

Our model is rich in the spatial labor composition and disease tracking dimensions, which seem critical for the recovery of the contagion parameters. It simplifies in others. Importantly, it may only look at the direct, short-run, economic consequences. In particular, the production model is additive, as in [19]. This means that it doesn’t take into account production interdependencies among industries. Neither does it consider other general equilibrium effects, such as price adjustments, innovations, or technology adaptations that are likely to occur in time. Indeed, while some job vacancies are destroyed, others are created, as people cope with the new conditions; such dynamics are absent from our model. Therefore, evaluations concerning periods longer than a few months should be considered as first-order approximations.",Yes,https://zenodo.org/records/4829304, Unclear,,Two different disciplines,"Social Sciences, Industry",Economics,"Research Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management (CIGIDEN), ANID/FONDAP/15110017, Santiago, Chile

We assume that cases with mild illness in the group of home office workers are either absent from work or work despite feeling sick with is reflected in a loss of productivity of about 60% (absenteeism & presenteeism). Cases in groups I and II who cannot WFH are assumed to be absent from work over the period of their mild sickness.23

Using the average weekly income as measure for productivity is a standard approach and follows the assumption that marginal productivity is equal to the marginal cost.24–26

We assume that no further losses occur as keyworkers may still send their children to school or day care.19 For workers in Group II, non-essential workers without the possibility to WFH, there are two sources of productivity losses: the losses related to their own illness and mortality, as well as productivity losses arising from childcare duties due to school and nursery closures for single parents (Single parent) or parents living with only employed household members with whom child caring duties are assumed to be shared (Shared parenting support). We assume zero productivity losses where parents can rely on an unemployed adult household member to care for the child(ren) (Full parenting support). We assume zero productivity in Group III due to government enforced shut down of businesses for employed workers who cannot WFH.

Non-health-related productivity losses for this group are caused by decreased ability to perform work-related tasks due to several potential factors: being a single parent with no other household member to share childcare duties (WFH single parent), living with an employed partner or other employed household member where child caring duties are assumed to be shared (WFH shared parenting support) or living with an unemployed partner or adult household member who can look after the child (WFH full parenting support). These subgroups are assumed to have no child-care obligations and can work either from home or their workplace.

Assuming that mortality is invariant between Groups I, II, III and IV, we compute mortality effects over the whole employed labour force by 10-year age-groups (16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64).

Productivity effects related to morbidity and non-health reasons are identified by multiplying IBM average weekly predictions of population proportions of (i) non-infected and asymptomatic infected; (ii) mildly sick not requiring hospitalization; (iii) infected requiring hospitalization (IBM predictions) with the total weekly wage income in each of the four groups (Group III is always zero per assumption); and (iv) proportions of family composition, productivity for keyworkers and non-essential workers and home office efficacy parameters, where applicable by groups (QLFS).

Our analysis relies on various assumptions of parameter values.

Limitations
We acknowledge that unemployed and retired individuals can also have productivity effects on the economy; however, due to data limitations, we cannot assess effects on either of these population groups.

Our analysis has some limitations. We may underestimate productivity effects as healthy individuals that are staying at home can produce other goods and services (e.g. childcare, informal care, cleaning, cooking).

Due to data limitations, we cannot infer productivity measures for non-market activities and consequentially output and mortality effects for these populations.

Based on our findings, we advocate for wider adoption of outbreak simulation technology to study the implications of social mixing patterns on outbreaks in close-knit communities to aid pandemic preparedness and response.

Finally, we demonstrate that the granularity of OO data enables institutions to mitigate outbreaks by proactively and strategically testing and/or vaccinating individuals based on individual social interaction levels.

OO then processes these simulated transmissions into summary statistics useful for students, teachers, and administrators alike, including levels of social interaction and risk of exposure broken down by participant as well as for the group at large. These statistics also feature as part of the OO curriculum, allowing participants to engage directly with epidemiology through experiential learning.

As revealed by our regression analysis, these second-degree contacts significantly impact individual-level risk and, therefore, may help public health authorities best identify individuals who are most liable to contracting or transmitting the virus.

Based on these models, institutions may view how various pathogens with different epidemiological parameters will likely propagate through the population.

This is a place where such an educational outbreak simulation can be useful as an opportunity for communities to think through varying behavioral responses and outcomes in a low-stakes setting.

The data generated by the OO app may be used for further epidemiological analyses of various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission characteristics, such as the high overdispersion that results in most introductions going extinct.

To estimate the sensitivity of tests according to how long an individual has been infected, we used data from Kucirka et al. (2020) to fit a logistic regression model using splines to fit a non-linear relationship between sensitivity and date relative to symptom onset. To account for dilution effects on sensitivity, we reduced the sensitivity of pooled tests by 16.4%, as was given in the COVID-19 example with pool size of 5 in Polage et al. (2020). The specificity was set at 0.995

In computing the optimal pooling assignments, we did not use the ABM described above as our data generating function F. This was done intentionally for two reasons. First, while the ABM was not computationally onerous, it still required too much time to be used efficiently in the ABC algorithm described in Section 2.2 in our simulation study. A second and most important reason is that in practice our models will always be a simplification of reality with incorrect parameter estimates, and in our simulation study we wished to accurately reflect this disparity between how the data is actually generated (the ABM of Section 3.1) and how the data is posited to have been generated (F as described below)

Values larger or smaller than this tended to yield prevalence rates too low and too large, respectively. As described in the next section, we altered the true network A in various ways when implementing our SIS simulator, which in turn was used to estimate the P(y′ p 1Kp = 0) and �p values in the simulated annealing algorithm

We ran 250 simulations for each setting, recording the total number of tests and total number of correct classifications from each

From this we obtain an optimal pool size of K = 13. It should be noted that while this will not be true in general, in this case the changes in the objective function are driven almost entirely by the changing number of tests required; the expected number of correct classifications for either approaches only ranged between 0.987 and 0.989 for all K we tried

Text: 
Overview of scenarios based on the distribution considered for the individual transmission probability and the individual contact factor.

We found that neither increasing heterogeneity in infectiousness nor increasing heterogeneity in contact behavior changed the locations where most infections took place, which for all scenarios were communities and households. ",Stay at home; Social distance (6ft),"Superspreading effects in the presence of social distancing. We considered a scenario to investigate the impact of different forms of superspreading on the effectiveness of a period with strong social distancing followed by a period of mild relaxations.
The scenario was implemented as follows: after the introduction of a single infected individual in the population we simulated 30 days without interventions, after which a ‘lockdown’ period began, in which schools were closed (primary, secondary, and tertiary education), contacts at the workplace were reduced by 94.51% and contacts in the communities were reduced by 88.74%. These contact reductions were inferred based on social contact data collected for Belgium from April to mid-May 2020 in the CoMix study [51].
After 60 days of lockdown (i.e. on day 90 of the simulation), a partial release of the lockdown followed. Schools were re-opened and contacts in the workplace increased to 25.09% of pre-pandemic levels, while contacts in the community increased to 28.55% of pre-pandemic levels. Again, these contact reductions were estimated based on data collected in the CoMix study, from mid-May to August 2020.",Yes,"More specifically, daily contact rates are based on asocial contact survey conducted in Belgium in 2010-2011 [46].

These contact reductions were inferred based on social contact data collected for Belgium from April to mid-May 2020 in the CoMix study [51].",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"We assume that individuals obtain immunity after recovery from the disease, and maintain this immunity for the duration of the simulation.

This probability determines whether an actual transmission event takes place whenever a contact occurs between the infected individual and a susceptible individual. We assume that this probability remains the same for the entire duration of an individual’s infectious period—one of the limitations we elaborate on in the discussion.

To do this, we introduced one infected individual in a completely susceptible population at the beginning of a simulation and tracked transmission events over a period of 200 days. Typically, after this period, no more new infections were recorded for all considered scenarios, so we assumed we had observed most, if not all, of the epidemic curve.

This is enhanced by the fact that STRIDE uses a structured population, in which individuals are limited in the contacts they can make by the constraints of the contact pools (household, school, workplace, communities) they belong to.

Limitations
Some limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting these results. Each individual that is infected over the course of the simulation, eventually recovers and gains immunity for the remainder of the simulation. As such, neither deaths nor re-infections occur. We also did not model the waning of immunity, nor vaccination, making these results more representative of the initial wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Additionally, we only introduce infected individuals at the beginning of the simulation, and do not take into account the continuous importation of infectious individuals into the population. Furthermore, we focus on the initial course of the infections, in which individuals can transmit the disease. We did not model hospitalizations with case isolation, since we assume the transmission dynamics are mostly shaped by the pre-symptomatic and mild symptomatic stages and individuals exhibit adapted social contact patterns once they become symptomatic. 

Finally, we only modeled heterogeneity caused by differences between individuals: heterogeneity in infectiousness and heterogeneity in number of daily contacts. However, several other factors might contribute to the occurrence of superspreading events. These can be attributable to differences between individuals as well, such as heterogeneity in susceptibility [55] or infectiousness that varies over time [35], or they can be attributable to differences in the environment, such as the differing spreading potential between indoor and outdoor venues or superspreading facilitated by mass events [25, 56, 57]. Although these factors may be important in the occurrence of superspreading events, we did not model them in our current study. We did however model two different community pools (for weekdays and weekend days, respectively), where individuals could potentially contact a larger number (up to 500) of people, which could serve as a proxy for attending a large event. However, large events also have a temporal aspect that is not modeled through community contact pools. As such, explicitly modeling mass gatherings might lead to new insights regarding the effect of different types of superspreading on disease spread and on the effectiveness of interventions. Furthermore, our implementation of contact heterogeneity implicitly constitutes a proxy for heterogeneity in contact environment as well.",Yes,https://github.com/elisekaa/stride,Yes,"We used STRIDE [45], an individual-based, stochastic model, which was recently adapted to encompass the disease-specific features related to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Belgian population [9].",Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Social Sciences","Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Computer software and media applications, Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences, Mathematics (general), Economics","1Centrefor Health EconomicResearchandModelingInfectious Diseases, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, 2 Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, Hasselt University, Hasselt, Belgium, 3 Artificial Intelligence Lab, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium, 4 Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 5 Global Health Institute, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, 6 NamurInstitute for Complex Systems, Department of Mathematics, University of Namur, Namur,Belgium, 7SchoolofPublic Healthand CommunityMedicine,The Universityof New South Wales, Sydney,NSW,Australia, 8 Expertise Centre for Digital Media, Hasselt University- transnational University Limburg, Hasselt, Belgium",No,,Verification; Sensitivity analysis,"Verification. We verified our implementation of superspreading in STRIDE in a number of ways. First, we confirmed that the mean R0 remained stable over the different scenarios regarding infectiousness-related and contacts-related heterogeneity, to ensure that the differences we observed were indeed due to variations in infectiousness- and contact-related heterogeneity. We found that the mean R0 was indeed consistent between the different scenarios, although the variance did differ—which we expected.
We also checked that the baseline case—in which both the individual transmission probability and the individual contact factor are constant—corresponds to a scenario in which either the individual transmission probability or the individual contact probability follows a Gamma distribution with respectively αi =10 and αc =10. This should be the case, since, as the shape parameter α approaches infinity, the dispersion of the distribution decreases, and the distribution becomes more centered around the mean.

Furthermore, we calculated P80: the minimal proportion of infected individuals that is responsible for 80% of cases—a measure commonly used in the superspreading literature [22, 28, 29]. We calculated P80 for each simulation by ordering individuals that were infectious during the simulation according to the number of secondary cases they caused, in decreasing order. Next, we compute the proportion of individuals that are responsible for 80% of the total number of infections caused over the entire simulation run. We used this measure to verify that as we decreased either αi or αc, this resulted in more heterogeneity in transmission—leading in turn to a lower P80.We observed that this was the case, but the effect was stronger with the same values for αi compared to αc. This is shown in Fig Bin S2 Text. Finally, we constructed atheoretical description for the transmission process in STRIDE, which allowed us to calculate the expected number of secondary cases per infected individual, as well as the variance of this quantity. We then compared the results of this theoretical description with simulation results for different forms and levels of superspreading. We observed that the results of our analytical calculations were largely in agreement with the results obtained through simulations, which is shown in Fig C–N in S2 Text.

If some individuals in the node set V2 may change their minds and take precautions against disease as time passes, then the above network optimization models become dynamic network models.

Specifically, Constraints (13a) ensure that if the number of infectious neighbors of i ∈ V2 exceed the threshold n0, then the individual will change the behavior. Constraints (13b) make sure that if an individual i ∈ V2 change the mind at period t (i,e., zi(t−1) = 0, zit = 1), then the total number of infectious individuals must exceed the threshold n0.

Constraints (15a)–(15e) represent the new dynamic transmission rules when some nodes in V2 may change the behaviors at time t. The new transmission rules consider three cases: (a) whether the neighbor j of i is infectious at time t − k, (b) whether j ∈ N− G (i) take precautions at time t −k, (c) whether i takes precautions at time t −k.

Then, it considers the diffusion process that the seed nodes in D can “influence” their (inactive) neighbors to be active, the newly activated nodes can further activate their neighbors, and so on.

Suppose that an individual i ∈ V2 take precautions (e.g., wears a mask) if the number of infectious neighbors of i exceed the threshold n0 and we introduce new binary variables zit to indicate whether node i ∈ V2 take precautions at period t if zit = 1 or not if zit = 0.

Transmission process is similar to the SI compartmental model. (2) Infections do not give immunity upon recovery from infection. That is, once a person is recovered from infection, he/she become susceptible again. Transmission process is similar to the SIS compartmental model. (3) Infections do give immunity upon recovery from infection. Namely, once an individual is recovered, the individual is no longer susceptible and becomes immune to the disease. Transmission process is similar to the SIR compartmental model.

Now we consider the SIS spreading process based on IM problem under LT. In compartmental models, we usually assume that the recovery rate δ is defined as the inverse of the duration of recovery, that is, the average recovery time for infectious disease is ⌈1/δ⌉, meaning that an individual is infectious for an average time period ⌈1/δ⌉ [37].

Further, we also assume that an individual i ∈ V2 can only change the behavior once during the spreading process, and then we obtain the following constraints: zi0 = 0,zit ∈ {0, 1} ∀i ∈ V2, t ∈ {1,..., T } (14a) zi(t−1) ≤ zit, ∀i ∈ V2, t ∈ {1,..., T } (14b) Constraints (14a) are binary restrictions for zit and indicate that each node i ∈ V2 do not take precautions at the beginning.

Text:
If the contact chain for any given individual exceeds a threshold number of contacts with persons exhibiting mild symptoms, it is potentially indicative of a developing Covid-19 outbreak around the geographical/social surroundings of such individual; thus, they can preemptively self-isolate and get tested, even before starting to exhibit symptoms or having any confirmed contact with an infected person. When a contact chain reaches a threshold, it can propagate warning information to all other devices in the network: namely, the average geographical location of all its mildly symptomatic contacts. All persons that have a contact within a specified distance of that point in their contact chain can preemptively self-isolate and get tested as well.

-- school closure",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not Stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Here, we assume the biological infectiousness of an infected individual is proportional to the within-host viral load (Fraser et al. 2007).

For simplicity, we assume lifelong immunity, so the recovered compartment (R) is the final state of the infected individuals.

In household layer, we assume that each individual is in contact with all family members.

Consequently, we assume that the immune response has already reached the maximum at the onset time τon (i.e., e(τon) ≈ a).

Hence, we assume the onset time of symptoms is τon = 5.5 and the peak time of viral load is τp = 4.5.

We make the assumption that all individuals in the youth group are students and are mapped onto the school layer.

Here, we assume there is only a single component (ns = 1ornw = 1) in the school and workplace layer, separately, because of the small size of the synthetic population and the lack of data.

Here, we assume that an individual will contact all family members and fixed classmates (or colleagues) during each day.

Note that individuals sleeping at night is similar to the quarantine-at-home policy (CDC 2022b), so we assume that infected individuals will not transmit virus during this time, since they will not be interacting with other individuals. Although some people are couples and sleep in the same bed, we assume that they already have ample opportunities to infect each other throughout the day or evening.

Hence, in the following investigations, we assume c = 0.56 for adults and increase c to represent the parameter value of viral dynamics within children.

Other vaccination schemes assume that all children in the corresponding age group are vaccinated and that the effectiveness of the vaccine is consistent with that of adults.

Our model has some limitations, which should be acknowledged. First, our population only included 10,000 individuals due to computational limits. Second, in the contact network, the school and workplace layers were not given a detailed substructure. The contacts occurring in different layers have different impacts, which depend on several factors such as type of contact, distance during contact, etc. However, we only weighted them by the relative fraction of a day an individual stays at different places, since we do not have detailed data. We omitted transmission events that may occur for couples sleeping in the same bed, which may underestimate the effects of household infection. Third, to simulate school closures, we only removed contacts occurring in the school layer, but did not consider the effects of this measure on contacts occurring in other layers because of the lack of relevant data. Fourth, Ke et al. (2021) found that there is a saturation effect on the infectious of viruses when the viral load is very high (e.g., 109 copies/mL). However, we assume the relationship between the viral load and infectiousness is linear, since our estimation for peak value of the viral load is less than 109.

TABLE 2 Indicators and assumptions adopted in the paper.

Assumptions (implied)

Certain sections, such as the fabrication and packing section, require intensive physical labor compared to activities in the kill and chilling sections.[71,73] We grouped the fabrication and packing (processing area and mixing and stuffing area) sections as one working zone and kill and chilling (holding cooler, prechill cooler) areas as another working zone. The real life operational functions of a plant are, of course, more complex. We reduced the complexity to flexibly model different scenarios.

We assigned all nonstationary agents the same moving speed. 

At reopening, plants relied on plastic barriers and surgical masks. We made two adjustments to our modeling to capture these measures. In the first, we increased the duration time to mimic the installation of plastic barriers.* In the second, we accounted for surgical masks. Surgical masks have an infection probability that varies between 3.5% and 20% among healthcare workers (HCWs)†,[78] and their laboratory‐based efficacy is between 37% and 69%[79]; we were conservative and adopted a 5% infection rate for our model.

Limitations

The limitations of our research largely derive from data availability. Neither the meatpacking plants, nor the government agencies fully disclose data relevant to outbreaks to the public.[87,103,104] Although our assumptions are grounded in the literature, some clearly could be refined. In any case, we leave the question of how to improve data collection of COVID‐19 for further research. We also adopted a model in which indicators (Tables 2 and 4) were static. This means, for example, that during a simulation the effectiveness of masks was the same over the 12‐h period.

It was hypothesized that a high level of tolerance for unfairness would lead to a more unfair distribution of resources in society, which would further result in higher numbers of infections and deaths, a greater number of days to end the epidemic (H2a), and slower control speeds in both stages (H2b).

Similarly, in the present model, the resource accumulation process was influenced by the initial resources that agents owned.

Model assumptions We referred to the SEIRD model to describe the development of the COVID-19 epidemic (Korolev, 2020; Huang et al., 2022). A basic SEIRD model includes five types of populations in a society: the susceptible, who are uninfected, healthy people; the exposed, who are infected but haven’t show symptoms; the infected, who are infected and show symptoms; the recovered, who have recuperated from COVID-19 and will not be infected again; and the dead, who are deceased. The model assumes that (a) the susceptible could be infected when the exposed or the infected are in their surroundings; (b) in the infection process, the exposed do not immediately display symptoms such as coughing and fever but experience an incubation period. After the incubation period terminates, they display symptoms and become known infected agents; (c) the infected have a certain possibility of recovering or dying, and the recovered will not be infected again; (d) when there are no longer exposed or infected individuals in society, the COVID-19 virus could not be spread further, and the model terminated.

(23 results)

We assume that recovered individuals (Fig. 1, spheres with black border), who resolve the infection, cannot be re-infected or infect others, which is a reasonable assumption for the duration of our models (45 days). 

Our assumption that wearing masks is more effective to reduce transmission than to prevent getting infected is supported by experimental data[25]. 

We started each simulation with one individual being infected and all others susceptible and assuming all subsequent infections have a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic.  Non-infected and asymptomatic individuals circulate in the population without any restriction (i.e., they do not isolate themselves or become hospitalized) (see Methods). In contrast, symptomatic individuals no longer move after 12 h of the symptom onset, simulating hospitalization or self-isolation. Thus, symptoms are assumed to manifest after the incubation time of 5.1 days (Fig. 2B). 

We assume that asymptomatic individuals are less infectious than symptomatic individuals: asymptomatic individuals may have lower viral loads and reduced coughing, sneezing, and nasal secretions, all of which may facilitate transmission[35–37].  The model considers that symptomatic infected individuals isolated themselves 12 h after the onset of symptoms, because they get hospitalized or self-isolated. In contrast, asymptomatic individuals remain infectious, circulate and transmit for a period of 7 days (Fig. 3A). Because some individuals can be pre-symptomatic [i.e., symptoms emerge later after the initial incubation time (Fig. 2B, t =5.1 days)], we modelled infectivity of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic as linearly declining until the individual is no longer infectious, after 7 days[38]. 

To relate the impact of these interventions to their societal impact, we determined the number of deaths per million after each mitigation strategy, assuming a mortality rate of ~3%[39].

In our simulation, we assumed proper use of FDA-approved surgical face masks, as well as widely available cloth masks (flannel). 

Assuming a homogenous population, the trajectory of epidemic extinction lasts 50–60 days, when 80% of the population either wears masks or practices SD (Fig. 4C).

We refer to Ferguson et al. for defining the rules governing the interactions among individuals[24]. For the interaction between symptomatic infected and susceptible individuals, the infection probability was randomly sampled from a gamma distribution with a mean of 1 and a shape of 2.5, whereas for that between asymptomatic infected and susceptible individuals, the infection probability is reduced by 33%. We assume this reduction of infectivity for the asymptomatic, based on the absence of transmission-aiding symptoms, such as coughing, sneezing, and a runny nose[24].  The time between a susceptible individual being exposed to being in the infectious 
infected state is 5.1 days24. Pre-symptomatic agents are defined as infected agents during the incubation period. Symptomatic infected individuals are infectious for 12 h before self-isolating. After this time, we assume that these individuals no longer infect those around them because they are hospitalized or self-isolating. Asymptomatic infected individuals are infectious for 7 days, and the infectivity linearly declines until the individual is no longer infectious on day 7[38].

We calibrated our model by running simulations without any individuals wearing a face mask or practicing SD and considering that 50% of infected individuals are asymptomatic at the beginning of the simulation, with each new infection throughout the epidemic having a 50% probability of being asymptomatic (Movie 1). In this way, we determined the simulation parameters, such as velocity and density of individuals, to obtain a value of R0=2.5, consistent with what was reported early on as the infection rate of the epidemic in Wuhan[9].

Using these assumptions, we performed a sensitivity analysis by carrying out simulations, varying the percent of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases to determine the efficiency of non-pharmacological interventions in populations with 25, 50, and 75% pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals (Fig. 3).",Yes,"Using these assumptions, we performed a sensitivity analysis by carrying out simulations, varying the percent of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases to determine the efficiency of non-pharmacological interventions in populations with 25, 50, and 75% pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals (Fig. 3).

A strength of modelling that can be difficult to communicate is that even in the presence of high uncertainty in forward epidemic projections, there may be low uncertainty about what is a superior intervention or policy option [21]."

Data on the number of beds in each HRR is obtained from the American Hospital Association (AHA) and a fraction of them are assumed to be available for COVID-19 patients

Once closed, schools are assumed to remain closed until end of August after which they reopen

We assume three scenarios regarding the use of hospital beds: (1) All COVID-19 patients who need a bed, will have one available i.e. there is no shortage of hospital beds, (2) bed capacity in each HRR is limited and beds cannot be shared among hospitals in other HRRs to accommodate the surge in demand for beds and (3) bed capacity in each HRR is limited but beds can be shared among hospitals in the neighboring HRR regions to accommodate the surge in demand.

The simulation results provide the counts of individuals who are in “hospitalized” state and depending upon the assumed duration of the hospital stay (7 days or 14 days), the demand for beds per day is calculated

We assume that patients who need a hospital bed and cannot get it, will die. This is a strong assumption, and hence, four different values of dedicated bed capacities have been considered to show its sensitivity. Note that only the death counts and overall costs will change in scenarios (2) and (3) when limitations to bed capacity are considered. This assumption of “all bed defects result in deaths” provides an upper bound on the medical costs resulting from the shortage of beds. If only a fraction of them die then the additional deaths and the costs can be appropriately scaled down

Figure 4 shows medical costs that are likely to result under different mitigation scenarios given the assumption that hospital-bed capacity is limited in each HRR and is fixed at a level given by AHA. However no sharing of hospital beds is allowed outside the HRR if there is a shortage of beds. It further assumes hospital stay on average is for 14 days and 70% of the beds are dedicated to COVID-19 patients27.

An analysis of costs under the assumption that hospital beds can be shared with neighboring HRRs shows that the shortage of beds can be completely alleviated by sharing",Upon request,,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Engineering, Life Sciences","Computer science, Computer systems networking and telecommunications, Civil Engineering, Health Sciences","1.

To keep the analysis more manageable we use a Latin Hypercube Sampling method to generate a random sample of parameter values from this multi-dimensional distribution28,29, to do the sensitivity analysis.

For this study we classified our policy change assumptions as being incorrect when the actual restriction change was actually made in the opposite direction to our assumption (e.g., we modelled a tightening of restrictions and an easing of restriction occurred) or when the timing of the policy change occurred more than a month from when we modelled it to occur. It is not surprising that these scenarios led to out-of-range projections: the projection for a scenario is not inaccurate if the scenario never transpired. However, in instances where the actual policy change occurred at the time that we assumed, forecast accuracy was only 49%. This could have occurred because either behavioral or health systems changes occurred that could not be quantified and captured in the model or because the policy and restriction changes had more or less impact than we assumed. For policy changes occurring in the past, the effect size of the restrictions can be calibrated; however, for future policy changes, this is not possible, and the effectiveness of future restrictions must be estimated based on the impacts they have had in the past. Tis introduces uncertainty because people’s behavior in response to public health directions may not be consistent over time. Tere are other limitations to COVID-19 modelling that may explain discrepancies in model projections. First, diagnoses and deaths are often underreported due asymptomatic cases, limited testing, limited health system capacity, or limited (or suppressed) reporting. Second, transmission is highly heterogeneous and even data at a city-level may result in epidemic behavior being smoothed out. Third, some of the data used to calibrate the models (up to July 2020) is likely to be outdated due to the emergence of new COVID-19 variants with increased transmissibility and mortality20. One example that is relevant to this study is in Brazil, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1 emerged as early as July 2020 and is estimated to be 1.4–2.4 times more transmissible than previously circulating variants21–23 (in Brazil, the epidemiological data was within the projected range 46% of the time). Fourth, with more than 6.5 billion vaccine doses administered globally as of October 19, 20211 , vaccine roll out plays a significant role in transmission from 2021. In the context of today’s highly transmissible variants, the impact of the different vaccines and the waning immunity on severe disease and deaths must be modelled accordingly, as well as (from a policy perspective) the deployment of booster doses including which vaccines will be used, when, and for which target populations.

The only statistically significant predictor of actual data within the predicted bounds was correct assumptions about future policy changes (OR 15.04; 95% CI 2.20–208.70; p= 0.016)

At the time the scenarios were being run, it was unclear what policy pathways each setting would take as they emerged from initial lockdowns; however, we assumed that it was unlikely to be a sudden policy change with return to pre-COVID behaviors in one step.

Calibration of the models was performed to fit multiple data sources in each setting: the reported COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths over time. This was done by adjusting parameters for the overall transmission probability (i.e. probability of transmission per contact per day between a susceptible and an infectious person, in the absence of vaccines), the proportion of people with COVID-19 symptoms being tested, and the effectiveness of the past policy changes (i.e. reduction in transmission when lockdowns were implemented). For each setting, past lockdown or policy changes were implemented in the models on the dates that they occurred, with the effectiveness of each lockdown or policy change deduced by calibrating the impact parameter in the model such that models reproduced the best fit to reported diagnoses and deaths.

For settings where the mortality data appeared inconsistent with diagnoses data, given testing rates, the mortality data was judged to be the more reliable indicator and prioritized in calibration. Simulations were run from the start date of the data for a given setting to October 31, 2020.

A sensitivity analysis was tested where a random-effects term was included for country to determine whether it might be influencing the outputs.

Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, by far, the most important predictor for accurately predicting the epidemic trajectory as compared with observed data is the correctness of assumed future policy changes (or scenarios) implemented in the models (p<0.05). A sensitivity analysis indicated that this was true even when a random-effects term was included for country.

In black-box validation, we adopted the pattern-oriented modelling approach [37] to assess the model’s ability to reproduce the following patterns observed in care homes in the UK: i) the higher risk of infection for residents and staff in care homes that frequently use bank/ agency staff compared with ones that do not use them [2]; ii) the higher risk of infection for bank/agency staff compared with permanent staff in care homes that frequently use bank/ agency staff [1,2]; iii) the higher risk of outbreaks in care homes that frequently use bank/ agency staff compared with ones that do not use them [2,38,39]; iv) the risk of outbreak occurrence in care homes specified by their size and staff-to-resident ratio [38,40,41].

Pattern i,ii, and iii help validate the behaviours of the overall system. Patterns iv addresses the validity of the sub-systems’ behaviour (care homes) when accounting for their interactions via bank/agency staff.

We performed a global sensitivity analysis for parameter uncertainty in the base case scenario and uncertainty analyses for structural and characteristic changes of the model to establish the robustness of the results and their uncertainty.

Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. We summarize the outputs from the PRCC analyses in Table Ain S4 Appendix. The per-contact transmission risk and the infection incidence in the community were the most significant contributors to the uncertainty in the number of infections in residents and staff. 

The number of infections was also sensitive to the staff resident contact rate and the duration of pre-symptomatic disease but to a significantly lesser extent. The RR of infection for bank/agency staff to permanent staff was only sensitive to the per-contact transmission risk.

In the first scenario, care homes in a network have the same average per-contact transmission probability of 0.02 calibrated for a single care home in Lanarkshire.

To obtain these distributions, we calibrated the hybrid model with heterogeneity in transmission risk to the time series of average daily infection prevalence produced by the baseline model with homogeneous transmission risk (Fig Bin S2 Appendix).",Yes,"We considered the cumulative number of infections in residents, permanent and bank/agency staff (medians and confidence intervals [CIs], interquartile ranges, and distributions)

Although each county used an independent predicted timeseries for REt based on the county-specific observed cases of illness, a simplifying assumption was made that calibrated disease parameters (listed in Table 1) were homogenous across all counties in a particular state when model was trained to replicate the state-level observed cumulative number of cases and deaths between March 15, 2020–October 31, 2020.

Key sources of uncertainty in our model potentially included model structure (e.g., set of differential equations identified for disease dynamics), model detail (e.g., simplifying assumptions related to reinfection as well as between county population movements), model calibrations (e.g., state versus county-level parameter calibration), and scenario reasonableness (e.g., assumption of homogenous age-stratified reproduction numbers.

Furthermore, our model relies on the current body of evidence with regards to the chances of reinfection. In this sense, recovered patients are considered to be immune to future COVID-19 infections. These assumptions are being revised as new viral variants are identified, which might imply the need to redefine the basic assumptions of the model.

We also acknowledge that there were multiple sources of uncertainty in our model resulting in prediction inaccuracies and errors as reported in Tables 4 and 5.

Also, while we used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 to characterize location-specific timeseries for RE, future values were approximated using exponential regression models fitted to the latest two weeks of data.

Throughout the fall semester, we adjusted the proportion of students sampled in each category (i.e., residential undergraduates, non-residential undergraduates, non-residential graduate students, and student athletes) based on their observed case incidences. The testing proportions were determined by the modeling subgroup and the university COVID-19 taskforce.",,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
Contact pools focused on housing structure rather than classroom structure because we assumed that the University’s physical distancing and masking policies would lower transmission rates within the classroom to a negligible level. This assumption was later confirmed through contact tracing data, and has been borne out in other university settings [23].

Room pools were the exception to this rule; each agent’s contact network contained their roommates every day, an assumption that both the University’s contact tracing data and reports from other universities subsequently validated [9].

Since non-residential students only belonged to the community pool, we allocated their remaining contacts to non-students under the assumption that non-residential students would mix more with the surrounding community.

Assuming that the expected number of infections in every transmission chain is constant given residential versus non-residential designation and that the susceptible pool does not become significantly depleted, the expected number of infections at the end of a simulation should be proportional to the rate of imported infections.

If a student tested positive, they were removed from the sampling frame for 90 days under the assumption that they had acquired natural immunity and based in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance that did not recommend PCR testing within 90 days of confirmed infection [34].

The two best fitting scenarios used the same contact rate but differed in R0,which under the model’s assumptions, suggests a shift in the probability of transmission.

The model’s assumptions favor a proportional relationship between the final cumulative cases and the rate of imported infections.

Assuming comparable results would occur using the effective reproductive number, these results validate the University’s strategy of shifting sampling rates based on current incidence data.

The delayed-symptom-monitoring scenario assumed the symptom-monitoring application was missing, and the students’ expected waiting times for testing were 4.82 days, the same as the general population [33].

Our model assumed every student faithfully used the application daily and would report symptoms to the app earlier than they would otherwise seek treatment.

Therefore, it is crucial to explore the relationship between the dynamic movement of people, indoor spatial structures, and the risk of virus inhalation to develop detailed guidelines for controlling disease transmission in urban areas.

In this article, we reviewed experimental studies on virus dynamics, including the number of droplets released from different respiratory behaviors, droplet size distribution, and droplet travel patterns, to establish virus dynamics in ABMs. We then built pedestrian ABMs that simulate individual virus inhalation patterns in symmetrical and formulaic spaces under several scenarios, such as varying virus amounts, configurations of spaces, and initial infected populations.

We assumed that this phenomenon would also apply to breathing and speaking, as the speed of droplets from these behaviors is slower than that of coughing.

Regarding the speed of droplets, we assume that droplets from respiratory behaviors reach their maximum distance in a second.

Assuming that a certain number of virus copies are exhaled from the mouth of each agent, we conducted an ABM simulation that incorporated this assumption to simulate the risk of disease transmission.

We chose to set the simulation running time to 10 min, based on the assumption that even regular air circulation may not be sufficient to curb the risk of infection.

We assumed that the virus copies are evenly distributed in one cell, which was based on Schijven et al.'s (2021) assumption of evenly distributed virus copies in a room to measure exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among individuals.

We assumed that every droplet reaches its maximum distance instantaneously after emission, as shown in previous studies (VanSciver et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2006). In our simulation, we assumed that agents wear one of three types of masks: (1) surgical masks, which transmit 0.06% ± 0.03% of droplets within a 6 ft distance, (2) PM 2.5 masks, which transmit 0.7% ± 0.48% of droplets, and (3) cloth masks, which transmit 3.61% ± 0.46% of droplets (Akhtar et al., 2020).

Limitations
This study has some limitations that should be noted. Firstly, while ABMs ensure autonomous behavior similar to reality based on the heterogeneous characteristics of each agent, this behavior is still determined by the builder's limited and biased rules, which may not reflect the inner mechanisms of behavior in reality.
Secondly, we did not consider all the factors that influence infection such as an individual's immune system, temperature, humidity, and air pollutant concentration.
Lastly, if the model were developed in three dimensions, it would allow for a more detailed simulation of virus spread patterns based on people's heights and the modeling of virus movement in three-dimensional space.",No,,No,,One discipline,Social Sciences,Geography,"Department of Geography, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA",No,,Sensitivity analysis; Validation,"4.2 | Sensitivity analysis with emulator model section

In this section, we validate the indoor movement pattern. To achieve this, we utilized indoor trajectory data from Zhao et al. (2021), which captures the movement of individuals in an indoor conference venue.
To validate the movement in the simulation model, we selected two parameters to define the movement pattern in the main simulation: (1) speed and (2) group size.

Next, we implemented sensitivity analysis using a machine learning-based regression emulator to identify effective features on virus transmission.

However, since there is a large uncertainty that people expel the droplets following outlier amounts, the simulation established several scenarios by setting different amounts of virus release.

It takes into account specifics of a workplace, mask efficiency, and daily routines of employees, but does not require specific inter agent rules for simulations.

Verification and Validation (V&V) is an important aspect of using simulations for decision-making. The two concepts are often conflated, so we based our verification and validation efforts on the established literature. Sargent (2013) defined verification as “ensuring that the computer program of the computerized model and its implementation are correct.” That is, did the modelers build the model correctly? Sargent defined validation as “substantiation that a model within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model

Verification begins with ensuring that logic was written correctly for the intended results. Beyond reviewing the code for errors, much of the verification process involves running the model under extreme settings to ensure the logic responds appropriately.

the simulations are calibrated to data on patient and HCWs infections from genomic studies [1, 18, 19]",Yes,"Including a pooled asymptomatic testing scheme is found to have a modest (albeit statistically significant) effect, reducing the total number of nosocomial healthcare worker infections by about 2% in both the lockdown and non-lockdown setting

the LFDs and PCR tests also have different error pro files. We generate a CT value curve for each individual, allowing variation between individuals and by whether individuals are asymptomatic, or not as has been developed by Kissler et al. [26]

Only the nosocomial infections are considered as it is not possible to limit the infections that HCW workers get from the community using measures within hospitals. The patient infections are also assessed using the percentage reduction in patient infections over the baseline strategy. For both of these metrics, 95% prediction intervals are obtained across parameter sets and replications (as discussed later in this section) to assess if the values of the metrics are significantly different (statistically) from zero (i.e., that the pooled testing scheme used has no impact on the metrics versus the baseline). These inferences and significance calculations are based on the empirical distributions from the simulations and are not based on theoretical distributions.

The community prevalence data and admissions data used to model admission rates are taken from the Cambridge-PHE real-time transmission model estimates and SUS [14, 17, 28], respectively.

Each of the model settings is run for 20 parameter sets selected to represent a range of potential transmission scenarios and generated as described by Evans et al. [12]. These parameter sets vary in parameters that are unknown such as the probability of different groups in the hospital infecting each other. The parameter selection process used previously published work, where the initial parameter sets are generated by Latin hypercube sampling over a suitable range, [0,1] if the prior distribution is not known [32]. The outcome measures of patient and HCW infections over time from these parameter sets are then compared to the national patient and HCW infection datasets (Sit Rep, SUS, and SIREN [14–16]). The parameter ranges are then refined, and new parameter samples are generated until the parameter sets generated represent both the patient and HCW infection levels over time.

Each of these parameter sets is then replicated 20 times based on the number of replicates needed for the simulation output to stabilize (Fig. S1 contained in the Supplementary material). The means, and prediction intervals were taken over the 400 model runs (over the 20 parameter sets, each replicated 20 times to incorporate both parameter and stochastic uncertainty). The length of the simulation was kept to 100 days to keep the prevalence within the prevalence ranges for low, medium, high and very high prevalence

Table 1 shows the expected additional total cost in pounds (averaged across the 20 parameters sets and 20 replications) and 95% prediction intervals for the testing policies over 100 days.

Table 2 shows the average percentage decrease in nosocomial infections in HCWs from baseline for each of the testing methods not under lockdown. 95% prediction intervals have also been given, and settings where the testing policy significantly reduces this percentage from the baseline are in bold.

We found that there was a modest (albeit statistically significant) reduction in nosocomial HCW infections (around 2%) when incorporating the asymptomatic pooled testing design into the hospital testing policy

Although increased errors caused by dilution were not considered in our model for pools (they can easily be added when using this modelling in a future epidemic), we used the NHS’ recommended pool size where in their work with the University of Birmingham they found 100% concordance between the pools and individual samples i.e., all pools that contained a positive sample (as identified with individual PCRs) tested positive (seen in correspondence with Dr Andrew Beggs, University of Birmingham)"

Sensitivity analyses with population sizes of 1, 2, and 5 million showed that the median mortality rate is insensitive to the size of the synthetic population (Fig. S3).

We further used a 75 percent coverage in a sensitivity analysis (75% testing scenario Table S2).

We used mortality rates of 2 and 5 times in the sensitivity analysis (2*Hosp. Mort. and 5*Hosp. Mort. scenarios in Table S2).

Sensitivity analyses The distribution of the mortality rate is sensitive to only vaccine effectiveness (VE), but not the coverage of rapid antigen test, transmission intensity (R0), susceptibility of children, infectivity of asymptomatic case, reduction in home contact rate after detection, and changes in mortality rate when having no access to hospital beds (S3 Text). Therefore, we only kept different VE scenarios in further sensitivity analyses. More specifically, we kept the optimistic VE scenario for all locations and pessimistic VE scenario for only Shenzhen, since safe exits can barely be achieved for the other three locations even under the best-case intervention scenario when assuming pessimistic VEs (S3 Text). 

Sensitivity analyses Te results under other scenarios are shown in S3 Text. When assuming a high VE (optimistic VE scenario), it is possible for Shenzhen to achieve a safe exit even with the current vaccine coverage, number of ICU beds per capita, and without antiviral treatment

In the sensitivity analyses, we found that the impact of the proportion of symptomatic cases being rapid antigen tested (75% testing scenario) were insignificant under both the best- and worst-case intervention scenarios although it was more noticeable under the former than the latter.

To account for stochasticity, 48 repetitions were run for each simulation. The total number of deaths at the end of each repetition was recorded to estimate the median mortality rate.

Then for each intervention parameter set, we ran the simulation 48 times to account for stochasticity and estimated the median mortality rate at the end of each simulation.

GP models were used here as emulators of the original computationally intensive simulations due to their ability to make predictions with uncertainty in a significantly reduced amount of time [30].

To ensure that the GP models make accurate predictions, we used a ten-fold cross-validation design. We first divided all data into 10 subsets, each with 10 sets of intervention parameters and their corresponding median mortality rates, then used every combination of 9 of these to train the model and the one remaining as an out-of-bag testing samples to validate the model. After confirming the predictive power of the fitted models on the out-of-sample testing datasets, we again refitted the models with the whole dataset and used them to examine the importance of each intervention parameter through the permutation importance procedure [31].

A larger permutation importance score suggests that the shuffled parameter is more important, since a larger increase in the prediction error suggests that the model relies on this parameter to make accurate predictions

In order to address the uncertainties inherent in the stochastic nature of the simulation model, we randomly sampled 10 sets of simulated results and fitted a GP model to each set of them. Additionally, to account for the prediction uncertainty of the GP models, we generated 100 random samples from the predicted distribution at a new data point using each of these 10 GP models. We then combined these 1000 samples to estimate the 95% credible interval (CI) of the prediction

The overall IFR from the simulation was 0.08% (95% CI: 0.07–0.08%), very close to its observed value of 0.09% (95% CI: 0.09–0.10%)

The permutation importance score of the same intervention parameter for Shanghai is usually greater than that of other locations, since permutation importance measures the amount of increase in the root mean squared prediction error and Shanghai tends to have a larger prediction error due to its higher mortality rate (Fig. 3A)

We examine the cost–benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantining contacts of the infected. Quarantine can contribute substantially to mitigation, even if it has short duration and is done within households. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown

first scenario, nothing is done. In the second, contacts within the workplace are reduced by 75%, while in the third, contacts with friends and the public are reduced. Finally, we compare these with similar scenarios, but where good hygiene or keeping a distance reduces the probability of infection from all types of encounters by half

We will see that such a 1 step tracing and quarantine strategy (1STQ) can give a sizeable reduction in disease spread while costing fewer lost workdays than overall lockdown.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not Stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"The models often assume contact rates and disease transmission to be stratified by age3,8,9.

Within families, workplaces, and friend groups, everyone is assumed to know everyone

The slightly larger effect of social contacts reflects our assumption that these connections are less clustered than the workplace network. The two latter graphs show the scenarios where we both reduce infection probability within one group by 75% and overall infection probability by 50%

We further assume that the number of contacts per coworker remains the same, meaning that the number of contacts per person drops when workplace size is reduced.

We assume a testing efficiency of 20% chance of detection for each day a person is symptomatic

A noticeable objection to the 1STQ strategy is the fraction of cases with so weak symptoms that people do not contact health authorities. The effect of such limitations is in our model parameterized through the detection probability. From Fig. 3c one sees that when the detection probability goes below 3% (a rate of 1% per day) the peak reduction of the 1STQ strategy becomes only of the order 1 percentage point. It should also be noted that, since we rely on symptoms to determine who stays in quarantine, and people in the infectious/symptomatic stage are assumed to always stay in quarantine, we implicitly assume that all infected persons develop at least some symptoms at some point. This may be a break from reality.

One interesting point which we have not examined here, is that real-world social networks are heterogeneous, with a large variance in number of contacts. It may be expected, for example, that workers in customer-facing positions in shops will have a high risk of catching the disease and passing it on. The effects of this heterogeneity is examined more closely in Ref.21 Here, it is concluded that heterogeneity in the number of contacts enhances the effect of contact tracing,

We assume that agents ages 0-4 and 65+ do not interact in school/workplace peer groups. 

Our modeling assumptions are informed by literature, data analysis, and expert opinion through discussion with COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (CSMH 2022).

We shift this distribution as we account for vaccine efficacy before an agent enters the recovered state; therefore, we assume that all recovered agents are guaranteed two months of immunity. We assume that if an agent is vaccinated or boosted in the recovered state during the simulation, their immunity is extended by an additional time sampled from the same distribution. Finally, we assume that all immunity follows the same waning attributes regardless of an agent's attributes (e.g., age).

We assume there is no immune escape for boosted individuals, and they follow the waning immunity described in Section 2.2.

Assuming a time delay of two weeks from infection onset to recovery, the estimated infections two weeks prior to July 1, 2021, minus the total deaths as of July 1, 2021, approximate the total number of recovered.

We seed all active cases into the exposed state and do not assume an age distribution.

We assume that the likelihood of someone being vaccinated and their current disease state are independent.

All agents seeded into the recovered state through infection or vaccination begin immunity waning as described in Section 2.2 with one exception; when recovered individuals are vaccinated during seeding, we assume immunity is not additive.

In scenarios with early distribution start times, we shift observed uptake earlier in time, assuming the same uptake rate over the new period. We assume that there are no differences in vaccine efficacy or side effects due to vaccination in the earlier rollout scenarios.

This lesson manifested in the calibration of the Delta wave, as initially, we had all kids starting school at the same time, which was an inaccurate assumption.

4.1 Limitations The large age grouping forming the working-age adult population is limited in our model. As a result, we do not model differences in behavior that arise due to age within age buckets. This limits how we model comorbid conditions within the population and differing levels of social activity. Similarly, we consider 65+ as non-working-age adults. Thus, they do not have a workplace peer group that may not represent the populations given a geographic location. As a result, we may be underestimating cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for this age group, although in previous simulations, we have found results for this age group validated well. Additionally, we only illustrate the effect of high-risk chronic conditions within the population with diabetes. This would lead to a potential underestimation of hospitalizations and deaths. Additionally, we do not consider coupling effects such as resource limitations or changes in uptake behavior that may arise due to the shifted PI start times.

Given our assumption of additive immunity, we could overestimate the effectiveness of vaccines and boosters, leading to underestimating the disease burden. We also assume that protection from severe disease outcomes does not wane over time. This may also be overestimating the immune protection and therefore underestimating the disease burden.

Our implementation assumes that all immunity behaves the same regardless of immune history and age. This may impact the parameterization of the Delta and Omicron waves and, therefore, the reported hospitalizations and deaths.

The final limitation pertains to model calibration. Given the large number of parameters derived from data and literature, each with some uncertainty, and the limited number of outcome metrics to fit models, there are likely multiple possible parameter combinations that would yield a valid fitting. This may impact the results presented beyond the validation period and reduce the generalizability of the modeling results to other geographies. Additionally, we combine disease parameters sourced from multiple studies, which may yield biases due to differences in disease spread or population composition.",No,,No,,One discipline,Engineering,Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering,Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering North Carolina State University,Yes,"Our modeling assumptions are informed by literature, data analysis, and expert opinion through discussion with COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (CSMH 2022).",Calibration; Validation,"Here the Omicron transmission rate is tuned via model calibration to be 1.33 times more infectious than Delta (see Section 2.7).

It was estimated via calibration that 50% of the immune population became susceptible to Omicron.

2.7 Simulation Calibration
The simulation is calibrated using data from July 1, 2021, through March 14, 2022. The data used for calibration were the state-level hospitalizations over time and the cumulative state-level deaths, which were pulled from the NC DHHS COVID-19 Dashboard (NC DHHS 2022) and New York Times COVID19 data repository (NYT 2022), respectively. The primary parameters tuned to calibrate the model are the transmission rate, β, over time, and probability of severe outcomes (hospitalization and death) associated with Delta. These parameters have values derived from the literature (Appendix Table 1) and are subsequently tuned as follows to capture the disease spread in North Carolina. The calibration of the timevarying transmission rate occurs first, where the transmission rate is constrained to be monotonic and to increase over the time window corresponding to the introduction of the Delta and Omicron variants in North Carolina.

Validation is stopped when observed data fall within the 10th and 90th percentiles of each outcome with an emphasis on the peak height and timing for current hospitalizations and the last three months of the validation window for cumulative deaths. The validations are reported in Figures 3 and 4 in the results.

Other epidemic context-specific parameters that impact calibration are the percent reduction in severity from Delta to Omicron (Wolter et al. 2022), and the probability of immune escape associated with Omicron (Araf et al. 2021), the masking parameters stratified by urban, suburban, and rural (Delphi Epidata API 2022), and school starting times in North Carolina (PHG 2021). Again we use literature and data to inform these parameter values. A constant value is chosen and held constant throughout the calibration process.

Omicron is calibrated as 50% less severe for all immunity classes than Delta (Wolter et al. 2022).",Yes,"Our modeling assumptions are informed by literature, data analysis, and expert opinion through discussion with COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (CSMH 2022)

Here the Omicron transmission rate is tuned via model calibration to be 1.33 times more infectious than Delta (see Section 2.7)

Using an infection fatality rate of 0.5% (Hauser et al. 2020), we estimate the total number of cases required to generate the observed deaths.

parameter search concludes when the peaks associated with each epidemic wave are correctly timed. Next, ranges of severe outcome probabilities are searched manually to finetune the number of hospitalizations and deaths. The range of values searched is approximately ± 15%. Validation is stopped when observed data fall within the 10th and 90th percentiles of each outcome with an emphasis on the peak height and timing for current hospitalizations and the last three months of the validation window for cumulative deaths. The validations are reported in Figures 3 and 4 in the results.

After accounting for the varying school start times in the model, we achieved the correct shape peak and subsequently tuned parameters to fit the observed epidemic wave.

Comparing Figures 3C to 3D (changes to boosters under early childhood vaccination start time), earlier availability of boosters reduces the peak hospitalizations by 1,742 during Omicron. Comparing Figures 3A to 3B (changes to boosters under observed childhood vaccination start time), earlier availability of boosters increases the peak hospitalizations by 2,197 during Omicron. Comparing 3A to 3D shows that distributing childhood vaccines and boosters earlier reduces the Omicron peak by 2,512 hospitalizations. There is considerable uncertainty generated due to the immunity loss and reinfections that reduce the statistical significance of these differences.

Figure 3: Impact of Booster and Childhood Vaccination Timing on Hospitalizations.

Again we observe that earlier childhood vaccination is a primary driver for reducing cumulative deaths, though as can be seen by the wide percentile ranges, there is considerable uncertainty associated with waning immunity during the Omicron wave.

These quantities constitute the reward signal, providing feedback to the decision-maker. At the next decision point this feedback is used to evaluate the choice of at.

6.3. Spreading Parameters’ Selection
To correctly model the contagion evolution, we had to tune the simulator transmission probability, which is a fundamental ActoDemic parameter [6]. We determined it with an empirical procedure: we computed the average of ten simulations for every parameter’s value and we searched for the optimal value with a random search across the probability space, trying to chase up the real data curve in Reggio Emilia’s province (see Figure 8) and even in Emilia Romagna region (see Figure 9).

For Reggio Emilia’s province, the TP optimal value was 0.285. Moreover, the TP value identified for Reggio Emilia’s province was too high when applied to the whole Emilia Romagna scenario. The reason was identified to be due to the commuting mechanism. In fact, each province is also influenced by the contagions of the other provinces. Therefore, we searched for a new TP value which could be suitable for the region scenarios, and then we found 0.25 as the optimal value.

Validation

To achieve this goal, we implemented a spreading simulator using ActoDemic [6] and validated it on two of the most populated Italian regions: Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. 

Finally, to validate our model, we compared the simulation data with the official data provided by the Italian Government (Protezione Civile), named “Real Data”. Considering that the official data have been
recognized as seriously underestimated in the first wave of the pandemic due to the lack of molecular tests, we decided to compare with the results provided by the serological investigation led by the Italian authorities over the Lombardy population in July 2020 to understand the real impact of the spreading in the previous months (serological data).

499,Mauras 2021,Mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces and schools by hybrid telecommuting,Consensus,Yes,Our purpose is to assess and compare several telecommuting strategies in workplaces and schools in terms of their effectiveness in mitigating possible local outbreaks. ,Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",Yes,"In the current context where institutions and companies have to quickly take local organizational decisions and review their planning or agendas, our results should help inform public health decisions.",Yes, France,Considered and imposed,"First, we consider on-off strategies, in which alternatively, either 100% of employees or students do face-to-face work, or 100% do telecommuting (distance learning).

Second, we consider rotating strategies, in which 50% of employees or students do face-to-face while the other 50% do distance learning, periodically switching between the two groups.

We implement both types of strategies with different alternations: daily alternation (even day, odd day, not counting weekends) and weekly alternation (even week, odd week). Finally, we consider a full telecommuting strategy.

In all these scenarios, we allow the individuals to maintain a small fraction 25% of their original local interactions even while telecommuting (thereby modeling the case of imperfect compliance by the individuals).

We also investigate the impact of vaccination (or of otherwise acquired immunity), investigating a scenario where 40% of the population is partially immune and that partial immunity consists in a reduced but imperfect protection against virus acquisition and transmission.

Symptomatic individuals are assumed to self-isolate after one day of symptoms and therefore do not cause further contamination in the studied setting; on the contrary, asymptomatic individuals stay in the system and potentially transmit the virus throughout their infectious period.",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Practice good hygiene,"In order to assess to which extent telecommuting can help mitigating the dissemination risk, five containment strategies are implemented and assessed here. Two “On-Off” strategies that consist in allowing the whole group of individuals (pupils/workers) on site (1) every other day (On-Off Daily), or (2) every other week (On-Off Weekly). We also consider two “Rotating” strategies which consist in allowing half the individuals on (1) odd days, while the other half is allowed on even days (Rotating Daily), or (2) odd weeks, while the other is allowed on even weeks (Rotating Weekly).

We also investigate the impact of vaccination (or of otherwise acquired immunity), investigating a scenario where 40% of the population is partially immune and that partial immunity consists in a reduced but imperfect protection against virus acquisition and transmission.

Symptomatic individuals are assumed to self-isolate after one day of symptoms and therefore do not cause further contamination in the studied setting; on the contrary, asymptomatic individuals stay in the system and potentially transmit the virus throughout their infectious period.

The latter value is chosen to implicitly take into account the adoption of barrier measures including social and physical distancing, mask usage and hand hygiene.

The top left panel of S9 Fig shows that when a strict lockdown removes all persistent contacts (that situation is obtained in the simulation by multiplying the external contact graph by a factor of 0%), the outbreak probability drops from 27% to 17%.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
Assuming a baseline local reproduction number of 1.25 within the studied settings and no specific telecommuting measure implemented, the importation of the virus in the network leads to frequent local outbreaks (27% of the times for ahigh school, 25% for a primary school, and 26% for a workplace) and to a significant number of infections in case of outbreak, no matter the size of the studied network (34 infections on average in ahigh school of size 327).

Similarly to related works like [20], we assume a natural history that is an agent-based model that refines classical SEIR transmission models (see Fig 2): initially individuals are susceptible (S); once contaminated, having been exposed(E), they go through an incubation period, after which they become infectious (I) after which they are assumed to recover (R) and develop immunity.

We assume that transmission between an infectious and a susceptible individual happens through proximity contacts as the ones recorded in the contact network.

We assume that the fraction of asymptomatic individuals equals 40%, within the range of [21, 22]. Symptomatic individuals are assumed to self-isolate after one day of symptoms and therefore do not cause further contamination in the studied setting; on the contrary, asymptomatic individuals stay in the system and potentially transmit the virus throughout their infectious period.

All simulations are initialized with an index case in the graph assumed to have been contaminated by the outside world.

To model such interactions, we assume that there exists a background external graph Gext of persistent contacts that take place every day, whether workday or weekend, whether telecommuting or not.

Therefore, we further evaluated the impact of the different strategies on the probability of outbreak assuming a portion of the population was already partially or fully immunized.

Since several vaccines have been introduced simultaneously and may differ in their properties, we analyse the impact of strategies under different assumptions of vaccine efficacy in terms of preventing acquisition and/or transmission.

This conclusion holds even though we assume some persistent contacts between individuals and a fraction of their workplace contacts, when they are not at the work location (for example, colleagues meeting outside work).

This strategies classification was not affected by the introductions of assumptions on vaccine- or naturally-induced immunity; nor by the modelling of an hypothetical more epidemic variant circulating in a partially immune population assuming cross-immunity.

The assumption that symptomatic cases would isolate relatively quickly is consistent with current recommendations in school and workplaces where individuals are asked to stay at home when they have any suspect symptoms.

Indeed, if we set Rlocal 0 1:15, assuming that the local reproduction number is the same on weekends as on weekdays would yield RW =1.48; we then obtain that for full telecommuting RL = Re 0.53, and simulating the “4 days on, 10 days off” On-Off strategy from [31] yields Re 0.82.

Besides the above consistency checks, extensive sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the robustness of our results with respect to model assumptions and parameter values: graph of persistent contacts, asymptomatic probability, 20-second mean transmission probability, asymptomatic relative infectiousness, super-spreading transmission factor, length and dispersion of exposed period, of presymptomatic period, or symptomatic period, and number of days of symptoms before isolation.

We assume that symptomatic individuals self-isolate after one day of symptoms, while asymptomatic individuals (40% of the infected [15]) do not isolate.

Limitations of our study section
The results presented here should be interpreted in the light of our rather simple assumptions. Firstly, virus transmission is assumed to occur within the contact network only, thereby neglecting potential acquisitions through external contacts, such as family members or friends are not considered, with the exception of the index case.

Nevertheless, in order to more realistically model contact patterns in a situation where telecommuting recommendations are not strictly enforced or complied with, we assumed that telecommuting individuals maintain a fraction of their in-network contacts.

In order to assess how changes in persistent contacts network affect the reported results, we simulated the model for different assumptions related to the external persistent graphs.

Calibration of the transmission parameter section
The contamination parameter p0 is calibrated so that the baseline local reproduction number Rlocal 0 , defined as the average number of persons infected by the index case, equals 1.25.

We calibrated the baseline probability of transmission to ensure a baseline Rlocal 0 ¼ 1:25.

Interestingly, the attack rate also becomes much larger when the contact graph is replaced by a (calibrated) homogeneous graph (S5 Fig).

The robustness of our findings is confirmed by the extensive sensitivity analysis that we performed both on the graph structures and on the parameters of the epidemics, such as the dispersion of transmission probability, the fraction of asymptomatic patients, or variations of Rlocal 0.

Besides the above consistency checks, extensive sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the robustness of our results with respect to model assumptions and parameter values: graph of persistent contacts, asymptomatic probability, 20-second mean transmission probability, asymptomatic relative infectiousness, super-spreading transmission factor, length and dispersion of exposed period, of presymptomatic period, or symptomatic period, and number of days of symptoms before isolation. They are presented in S13–S17 Figs. These sensitivity analyses show that although the evolution of the epidemic varies greatly with the parameters, corresponding variations are smooth and the ranking of the strategies is always respected.

Nevertheless, both our results on the random network and our extended sensitivity analysis support the generality of our finding that all strategies globally reduce the dissemination risk and Rotating strategies give the best effect.

Five stages of PHSMs were specified (Appendix Table S4). Stages incrementally impose more restrictions up to stage 5, which approximates a lock-down. The ABM (de)escalates through these stages based on hospital occupancy thresholds and two PHSM policy options (higher and lower stringency; Table 2). We modelled two mask policies—(a) a respirator (e.g., N95 mask) substitution policy with options of no respirator provision or a respirator stockpile that is distributed to the population for use in place of cloth or surgical masks during large outbreaks (defined as when the model was in stage ≥3 of PHSMs) and (b) promotion of mask wearing during large outbreaks.

The former involved the addition of a “carefulness” parameter that interacted with biological susceptibility to infection to reflect varying infection-avoidance behaviour by age and achieve the age distribution of infections occurring in Victoria during the calibration period

Model calibration in this regard was performed in two steps: (a) specification of biological susceptibility difference by age (Table 1) and, critically, (b) a second step involving the addition of a “carefulness” factor that these susceptibilities were multiplied by for the model to output the age distribution of cases actually observed in Victoria. Therefore, if one was to set the biological susceptibility by age to be uniform, this carefulness scalar would change accordingly with little (if any) likely impact on model outputs. In other words, calibration to the pattern of cases by age surpasses the influence of the susceptibility by age parameter.

Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses

We generated tornado plots showing the variation in model outputs when comparing the lowest and highest quintiles of key input parameters. Additionally, we ran sensitivity analyses using an alternative discounting approach recommended by the UK Treasury 23 (1.5% for HALYs and 3.5% for costs), adjusting the WTP per HALY to $140,000 and $35,000, and assuming people dying of COVID-19 have 1.5 times the mortality and 1.25 times the morbidity of the average person of the same sex and age.

The mean number of infections generated by the model from 1 April to 30 September 2022 was 3.2 million (median 3.4 m, interquartile range [IQR] 2.5–4.1 m). The number of reported cases in Victoria in the same period was 1.3 million, 24 the same as the mean number of symptomatic infections output by the model. The mean number of COVID-19-related deaths was 2300 (median 2,200, IQR 1400 to 3000) compared to 2900 recorded in Victoria in the same period

The tornado plots shown in Supplementary Fig. S20 indicate that uncertainty regarding the transmission potential of asymptomatic compared to symptomatic individuals drove significant amounts of uncertainty across multiple model outputs.

Individuals in the asymptomatic compartments were considered less infectious than individuals in the symptomatic compartments and to remain undocumented unless tested;17 a sensitivity analysis was performed on the value of the reduced transmissibility in the asymptomatic stage. The model was parameterised with age-specific estimates of susceptibility, transmissibility, probability of developing symptoms, and probability to detect a case based on symptoms (appendix pp 4–6). A systematic review4 indicated that children (younger than 10–14 years) have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 than adults, but building evidence suggests that adolescents (older than 10–12 years) might be as susceptible as adults ( 20 years).4,18 Here, we considered a relative susceptibility of 50% in primary school children and 75% in secondary school adolescents compared with adults for the main analysis and 100% susceptibility in adolescents in a sensitivity analysis.

Here, we considered a relative susceptibility of 50% in primary school children and 75% in secondary school adolescents compared with adults for the main analysis and 100% susceptibility in adolescents in a sensitivity analysis. The probability of recognising a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from symptoms was set to 30% for children and 50% for adolescents and adults on the basis of studies indicating that about two-thirds of symptomatic children3 and half of symptomatic adults19 have unrecognised symptoms before diagnosis. These values were varied in sensitivity analyses (appendix pp 9, 51). We considered a relative transmissibility of 63% in children compared with adults as evidence suggests that transmission in children might be less efficient than in adults,20 and we tested 80% relative transmissibility in a sensitivity analysis.

The model was further stratified to account for vaccination status and to include vaccine e effectiveness against infection, transmission, and clinical symptoms given infection21 (appendix pp 9–12). Higher and lower values for vaccine e effectiveness were tested in sensitivity analyses. Full details on the transmission model are reported in the appendix (pp 4–13)

In sensitivity analyses, we relaxed the constraint on adherence (sensitivity inclusion criteria). Simulations for the fit covered the period from week 8 (starting Feb 22, 2021, at school reopening after winter holidays) to week 13 (ending April 4) before the reactive school closure, and they were initialised with age-specific seroprevalence estimates.22

Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible, suggesting the recommended interventions could successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fries. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed

These scenarios were tailored to the pre-2021 free season conditions. We addressed the uncertainty in vaccination rate and compliance to social distancing behaviors among wildland fire personnel by creating three distinct behavioral scenarios: a low behavior compliance scenario, a baseline scenario, and a high behavior compliance scenario. The “Low Compliance” scenario assumes less compliance with infection control measures (i.e., low effort to maintain social distancing and lower percentages of individuals correctly diagnosing their symptoms) and fewer vaccinated individuals. The “High Compliance” scenario assumes more compliance with social distancing, more frequent diagnosis of symptoms, and more vaccinated individuals.

The “High Compliance” scenario assumes more compliance with social distancing, more frequent diagnosis of symptoms, and more vaccinated individuals. The “Baseline” scenario assumes a moderate level of social distancing compliance, symptom identification, and vaccination. An overview of parameters used for each scenario can be found in the Methods section. 

Susceptible individuals are assumed to have no immunity to the virus gained by previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

We assume four leaders per module for all crew modules. 

Contact between module members is substantially higher than contact between leaders, as module members are assumed to eat, sleep, and socialize together. 

The diagnosis of symptoms is not assumed to be immediate upon entry to the infectious state: our model includes a parameter to specify the average amount of time it takes for personnel to recognize their symptoms and a parameter to specify the average percentage of individuals who ever correctly diagnose their symptoms.

Our model assumes full isolation during quarantine (i.e., isolated individuals do not transmit disease to any other individuals). 

For symptomatic individuals, this is less likely to occur than for asymptomatic individuals, as a percentage of symptomatic individuals are assumed to recognize their symptoms and move into isolation.

We held this parameter constant across scenarios except for the high compliance scenario, in which we assumed 70% of the overhead personnel would be vaccinated prior to the season. Because vaccination efforts were expected to continue into the summer vaccination rates mainly varied in their progression: the low compliance scenario assumed that no additional personnel would be vaccinated prior to July 1, the baseline scenario assumed 25% of overhead personnel would get vaccinated prior to July 1 and the high compliance scenario assumed an additional 40% of overhead personnel and 25% of crew personnel would get vaccinated prior to July 1.

We sought to identify improved strategies for preventing outbreaks in this setting using an agent-based model of a hypothetical cohort of trainees on a U.S. Army post.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",Yes,"In the event of other emerging respiratory viruses in the future, our model could serve as a starting point for exploring the possible impacts of such a virus and how best to control it to maintain basic training operations",Yes,United States,Considered and imposed,"Across the full range of 0 to 100% compliance with face masks and physical distancing, there was three-fold variation in the probability of an outbreak when there were no introductions by trainers or support staff (Fig 6A).

To cover this wide range of possible scenarios, we varied the proportion immune upon arrival from 0 to 90% in increments of 10%.

Compliance with masks and distancing 0.3 0.1 0.5 Chu et al. [25] Proportion immune upon arrival 0.026 0.018 0.033 Pei et al. [24]

Under the baseline scenario, testing occurred upon arrival and 14 days later, compliance with face masks and physical distancing was assumed as 30%, the proportion immune at the time of arrival was 2.6%, and trainers and support staff had a 1% chance of becoming infected in the community over the 70-day period of basic training.

Given the continually changing nature of the landscape of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and effectiveness, we chose to model vaccination in a simple way: by varying the proportion of agents immune at the beginning of the simulation. This corresponds to an all-or-none model of vaccination [30] in which the product of coverage and efficacy against infection equals our parameter for proportion immune. For example, 80% efficacy against infection and 80% coverage would correspond to 64% immune.

Our default assumption was that compliance with face masks and physical distancing was relatively low (30%) due to the physically intense nature of training and the fact that training entails large groups of people spending prolonged periods of time together. Given uncertainty about the appropriateness of our baseline assumption of 30% and the potential for compliance with these measures to be either disregarded completely or enforced strictly, we explored scenarios in which compliance ranged from 0 to 100%. We also explored scenarios in which compliance began at the baseline value of 30% and either decreased or increased linearly over the course of the training period (to 10%, 20%, 40%, or 50%).

In our baseline scenario, trainees were tested upon arrival and 14 days later, as well as any time they developed symptoms. Trainers and support staff were also tested if they displayed symptoms.

Individuals continued with their normal activities while awaiting test results, entering isolation in the event of a positive result and remaining there for ten days [29].

To understand the implications of different rates of introduction by trainers and support staff, we performed simulations under three different levels of introduction (0, 1%, 10%), defined as the proportion of trainers and support staff infected in the community over the course of the 70-day training period.",Get vaccinated; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Get tested,"Using this model, we examined how effective four interventions might be in reducing the probability and size of outbreaks in this setting: 1) reducing introductions of the virus into the basic training setting by trainers and support staff, 2) increasing rounds of arrival testing of trainees, 3) increasing compliance with wearing face masks and practicing physical distancing, and 4) increasing immunity among trainees through pre-arrival vaccination.

Interventions. The primary means of preventing transmission in the model involved testing for active infection and isolating test-positives.",Yes,"Compliance with masks and distancing 0.3 0.1 0.5 Chu et al. [25] Proportion immune upon arrival 0.026 0.018 0.033 Pei et al. [24]

We calibrated the model to data from testing upon arrival and 18–22 days later at two U.S. Army posts that experienced COVID-19 outbreaks.

Given the continually changing nature of the landscape of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and effectiveness, we chose to model vaccination in a simple way: by varying the proportion of agents immune at the beginning of the simulation. This corresponds to an all-or-none model of vaccination [30] in which the product of coverage and efficacy against infection equals our parameter for proportion immune. 

We assumed that a small proportion of individuals in the model were previously infected prior to arrival of trainees, consistent with the timing of reported outbreaks at two U.S. Army training posts in spring 2020. Given that those outbreaks were reported on May 31, 2020 and were based on testing on days 18 and 22 of training [17,54], we assumed that those trainees likely arrived during the week of May 3, 2020.

Based on estimates from a study [24] that modeled cumulative infections in the U.S. population over the course of the epidemic, a median estimate of immunity among trainees as of May 3, 2020 was 2.6% (95% CrI: 1.8–3.3%). These estimates are national averages of state-level estimates weighted by state-level Army recruitment rates [55]. We used the median estimate in the model calibration and baseline scenario, and we explored the lower and upper values in a sensitivity analysis.",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
The calibration informed the model’s assumptions about the initial prevalence of infection among recruits and transmission potential in a basic training setting, as represented by the basic reproduction number, R0.

We assumed values of most parameters based on the literature (Table 1) and calibrated two others (initial prevalence of infection, p, and the basic reproduction number, R0) for each of two U.S. Army posts with known outbreaks during basic training: Fort Benning (FB) and Fort Leonard Wood (FLW).

After accounting for the possibility of false negatives and false positives consistent with our model’s assumptions about test sensitivity and specificity, we obtained median estimates of p of 1.9% at FB (95% credible interval: 0.3–2.9%) and 0.9% at FLW (95% CrI:0.2–1.5%).

Under the baseline scenario, testing occurred upon arrival and 14 days later, compliance with face masks and physical distancing was assumed as 30%, the proportion immune at the time of arrival was 2.6%, and trainers and support staff had a1% chance of becoming infected in the community over the 70-day period of basic training.

This multimodal pattern was driven by stochasticity in the number of companies that experienced an outbreak affecting many individuals within the company but few outside it, consistent with the structure of contacts assumed in the model.

For instance, assuming high levels of introductions and 100% compliance with facemasks, previous immunity would need to be 40% to result in the probability of an outbreak to be zero.

Higher compliance with face masks and physical distancing than we assumed in our baseline scenario (30%) could also contribute to the prevention of outbreaks in some cases.

Assuming that symptomatic individuals continue to be tested and isolated if positive well into the future, our results suggest that half or more of trainees would need to be fully protected from infection for outbreaks in basic training to be prevented altogether.

We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a single cohort of trainees, their trainers, and associated support staff at a single U.S. Army training post, based on informed hypothetical assumptions from the operations in this setting.

This period was chosen based on the period in which test sensitivity was assumed to exceed zero under our model, which also encompasses the period of infectiousness.

We assumed that a small proportion of individuals in the model were previously infected prior to arrival of trainees, consistent with the timing of reported outbreaks at two U.S. Army training posts in spring 2020. Given that those outbreaks were reported on May 31, 2020 and were based on testing on days 18 and 22 of training [17,54], we assumed that those trainees likely arrived during the week of May 3, 2020.

For specificity, we assumed a constant value.

In addition to testing, we assumed that agents made use of face masks and physical distancing, when possible, to reduce transmission.

According to our assumptions about test sensitivity as a function of day of infection, 99% of positive tests should have resulted from individuals infected within 39 days of arrival, assuming a constant rate of infection over that period.

We defined the posterior probability density of p as which assumes a uniform prior on p.

Following calibration of the model, we added average values of initial prevalence and R0 to the list of baseline parameter assumptions in Table 1.

Our default assumption was that compliance with face masks and physical distancing was relatively low (30%) due to the physically intense nature of training and the fact that training entails large groups of people spending prolonged periods of time together. Given uncertainty about the appropriateness of our baseline assumption of 30% and the potential for compliance with these measures to be either disregarded completely or enforced strictly, we explored scenarios in which compliance ranged from 0 to 100%.

Limitations
One limitation of our analysis is that we did not have detailed information on contact structure within training units. In the absence of this information, we made the simplifying assumption that everyone within a training unit had equal contact with everyone else.

In addition, there is also uncertainty regarding the extent and nature of contacts among trainees, trainers, and support staff.

There are uncertainties about some of our parameter values, such as mask effectiveness, baseline immunity, and testing accuracy.

At the same time, we note that a limitation of this approach is that it does not convey the full uncertainty in model outputs attributable to parameter uncertainty, which would require a fuller accounting of joint uncertainty across all model parameters (e.g., as in [60]).",Yes,https://github.com/confunguido/prioritizing_interventions_basic_training,No,,Two different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Industry",Biological and Biomedical Sciences,"Department of Biological Sciences and Eck Institute for Global Health, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America, Viral Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States of America, Moncrief Army Health Clinic, Columbia, South Carolina, United States of America, United States Army Training Center, Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina, United States of America, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States of America, Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States of America, Henry M.

The calibration informed the model’s assumptions about the initial prevalence of infection among recruits and transmission potential in a basic training setting, as represented by the basic reproduction number, R0.

Model calibration section
We assumed values of most parameters based on the literature (Table 1) and calibrated two others (initial prevalence of infection, p, and the basic reproduction number, R0) for each of two U.S. Army posts with known outbreaks during basic training: Fort Benning (FB) and Fort Leonard Wood (FLW).

Following the calibration procedure, simulations of our model tracked a cohort of 1,200 trainees who spent their first two weeks of basic training in 20 cocoons of 60 and the next eight weeks in five companies of 240 (Fig 1).

Given that calibrated values of p and R0 from FB and FLW were similar, we used the averages of their medians for p (1.3%) and 0.1% quantiles for R0 (6.1) in our baseline scenario. We chose the 0.1% quantile for R0 because the outbreaks at FB and FLW were unusually large and because values of R0 within this range resulted in model behavior with greater sensitivity to changes in other model parameters than higher values of R0 did.

Calibration of our model to data from two known outbreaks in military basic training settings resulted in a point estimate of initial prevalence among recruits of around 1% at that time, with testing from one of those outbreaks yielding zero positive tests upon arrival and implying one or more false-negative test results.

Although introductions of SARS-CoV-2 by trainees have been implicated in high-profile outbreaks such as the ones we used to calibrate our model, our analysis predicts that trainers and support staff could play an even greater role in introducing the virus into basic training settings.

Our calibration resulted in estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0 of 11.3 (95% CrI: 4.9–17.9) and 10.4 (95% CrI: 4.5–17.8) in the two outbreaks used in our calibration.

We used the median estimate in the model calibration and baseline scenario, and we explored the lower and upper values in a sensitivity analysis.

Model calibration section
We calibrated the model to two known outbreaks in U.S. Army training posts: Fort Benning (FB) [54] and Fort Leonard Wood (FLW) [17].

Because no information about infections among trainers or support staff were provided in these reports, we limited the calibration to infections among trainees only. We performed this calibration procedure separately on the data from FB and FLW.

Following calibration of the model, we added average values of initial prevalence and R0 to the list of baseline parameter assumptions in Table 1.

The first of those parameters was R0, which had extremely wide ranges of uncertainty in our model calibration that likely exceed the true range of uncertainty about this parameter.

Counterintuitively, we found that outbreak risk is driven more by virus introductions from trainers than the large number of trainees, and that outbreak risk is highly sensitive to false-positive results during entry testing.

Sensitivity analysis section
For model parameters not evaluated in our analysis of interventions, we performed a sensitivity analysis to understand how variability in those parameters could affect outbreak probability and size.

With respect to outbreak probability, sensitivity was greatest to lower values of the initial prevalence of infection among trainees, as well as the parameters for the generation interval distribution and test sensitivity (Fig 8A).

There was also considerable sensitivity to low values of test specificity (Fig 8A).

The parameters to which outbreak size was sensitive differed according to the extent of community exposure for trainers and support staff. When there were no introductions from trainers or support staff, the greatest sensitivities were to low values of test specificity and longer isolation periods (Fig 8B).

At our baseline level of community exposure for trainers and support staff, there was moderately high sensitivity to several parameters (Fig 8D). At the highest level of community exposure, sensitivity of outbreak size was greatest to low values of R0 and high compliance with face masks and physical distancing, with smaller outbreak sizes in both cases (Fig 8F).

Likewise, our sensitivity analysis showed that seemingly minor imperfections in test specificity can exacerbate this phenomenon.

We addressed these uncertainties through a sensitivity analysis, which showed that outbreak probabilities remained similar to our baseline scenario under a range of parameter values.

Sensitivity analysis. To understand sensitivities of the model’s behavior to parameters not explored in the intervention analyses, we conducted a univariate sensitivity analysis for all other model parameters. These parameters, and the alternative low and high values that we explored, are listed in Table 1. For each alternative parameterization, we ran 1,000 simulations and calculated the probability of an outbreak and the size of one, if it occurred.

Once the synthetic units, at each center, were created, we assigned individuals from the population to those units. First, we filled each unit with individuals of that specific age that have their homes located in the same district. Secondly, the units that had not been filled totally with individuals from the same district were filled with individuals from other districts, with a priority determined by the distance between the centroids of the districts, until all the units in the city were full. We assumed that, after that step, the remaining individuals were not included in the education system.

We obtained the distribution of companies’ sizes (S) throughout all the Spanish provinces, which follows a power-law distribution pdf (S)∼ S−2.

We did not consider as potential workers those that were assigned a school patch, either as teachers or students.

Limitations

This work has some limitations that deserve further discussion. First of all, our simulations considered a single randomly chosen initial seed, and from this, we estimated the date of arrival of the disease. Nevertheless, the spreading process could have started by the arrival of several infected individuals either synchronously or asynchronously. However, we think that these approaches are equivalent, as they would lead to the same number of infected individuals at later dates. In contrast, different effects could emerge when specific individuals, according to, for example, their age, district of residence, or employment status, display a higher likelihood to introduce the infection. Another limitation is the isolation of the cities, as they are considered closed systems. This can be solved by introducing a spontaneous infection rate reflecting the imported cases from other locations, although we assume that in the cases of generalized local transmission this rate would lead to minor differences. The emergence of variants with different infection and recovery rates and death probabilities is challenging for these models, requesting the parameter correction for subsequent waves happening when other variants were present. The latter, however, does not impact predictions at the early stages of an emerging disease, which is when evaluating possible NPIs is most needed.

In summary, we assumed the number of new cases of the next generation was sampled from the NBD of each source case of the current generation. 

Limitations

Our study has the following limitations. First, as our time-varying estimates rely on contact tracing data, it is expected that any degree of case under-detection and recall bias would bias our results.

Second, although our sensitivity analysis on window size showed similar results to our main analysis, we found that the credible intervals of the estimates become too wide to inform policy when we set the window size to 7 days or 14 days (we did not show the result). 

Third, our time-varying estimates should be interpreted with caution, given that a transmission cluster could involve possibly multi­ple generations, possibly crossing different public health intervention phases.

Fourth, we used the serial interval distribution that was inferred from our identified transmission pairs when determining the censoring of a cluster. 

Finally, although our estimation framework provided a possible way to jointly estimate the time-varying R and k in nearly real-time by using the transmission cluster data, contact tracing measures were limited especially during an ongoing epidemic, such that the transmission cluster data would not be timely available to enable the real-time estimates.

Anonymised community testing data, including details on the type of test and results, were provided through a data-sharing agreement between Public Health England and the authors’ institutions.

The model was fitted to swab testing data recorded in 11–16 year olds collected in the wider population from both PCR tests and LFTs, referred to as Pillar 2 data, which we took as a proxy for positive testing rates within secondary school pupils.

Another use of the Pillar 2 data was to inform the level of community infection and level of LFT participation within each LTLA in the model.

Schools continue to implement the isolation of close contacts policy used by schools from 31st August to 18th December 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
The LFT data are best explained by a model that assumed only 38% (95% credible interval: 31–51%) of negative home LFTs are in fact reported.

With an assumed LFT specificity of 99.97%, the data were best explained by a model that assumed only 38% of negative home LFTs are reported.

For this computation we assumed that all pupils scheduled to take a test on a given day do so with a probability p, and we varied p from 0 to 1.

The required participation increases to 24% (95% prediction interval: 0-57%) with a policy of mass testing with serial contact testing (assuming that all close contacts undergo serial contact testing).

While we estimate there have been relatively low levels of LFT participation in secondary schools in England (approximately 36%, assuming a 99.97% LFT specificity), we demonstrate that LFTs have nevertheless played an important role in reducing incidence within secondary schools, which will have consequently reduced incidence in the wider community.

When considering serial contact testing, this study optimistically assumed that all pupils agree to participate in daily testing if identified as a close contact of a positive case.

Schools were assumed to implement consistent isolation policies throughout each term, meaning that close contact group sizes were fixed within each school.

We assumed 100% PCR specificity (in line with data indicating that false PCR positives are very rare62) and 99.97% LFT specificity (in line with estimates obtained from analysis of LFTs taken in secondary schools in England51).

In the main analyses, we assumed pupils mainly mix with their year-group close contacts and assumed very low levels of mixing between years (Fig. 4a); we explored sensitivity to this assumption in Supplementary Text 8 and obtained qualitatively similar results (Supplementary Figs. 19–21).

It is assumed that all pupils participate in serial contact testing when identified as a close contact of a positive case.

A pupil’s probability of external infection on day t depends upon prevalence in the community, which we assume to be proportional to the proportion of the population in that LTLA testing PCR positive on day t + 5.

Limitations
Accordingly, our study has several limitations. The following paragraphs discuss the study’s limitations regarding: (i) transmission and contact structure, (ii) mass testing, (iii) vaccination, (iv) other aspects of school transmission, and (v) the interpretation of inferred parameters.

Our study assumed three levels of mixing, with pupils transmitting infection at high rates to their close contacts, at a lower rate to other pupils in their year, and at a yet lower rate to pupils in other years. Assuming that schools implemented consistent isolation policies throughout each term, we also assumed that close contact group sizes were of a fixed size for each school. While this assumption allowed us to successfully match to absence data throughout both terms, we acknowledge it limits the heterogeneity in contact patterns within schools.

We also assumed, due to data aggregation, that the proportion of secondary school pupils taking an LFT test on a given day is equivalent to the local proportion of 10–19 year olds in that school’s LTLA taking an LFT on a given day, i.e. we assumed participation was homogeneous across schools within a region.

Further, we assumed that all pupils have an equal probability of taking an LFT to satisfy a given level of participation; in reality, some pupils may consistently take LFTs, while others may not.

Accordingly, our model assumes the impact of transmission from teachers to pupils comprises some proportion of ‘external’ infections.

Similarly, inferred parameters should be interpreted cautiously and in the context of the underlying model assumptions. For example, the model fits the proportion of infected secondary school pupils who are symptomatic and the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, under the assumption that all symptomatic individuals seek a test upon symptom onset.

Similarly, levels of underreporting are inferred under the assumption that LFTs during mass testing schools have had a 99.97% specificity (in line with contemporary estimates50,51). Lower assumed LFT specificity would yield lower levels of underreporting, as more false positives would occur for a lower number of tests.",Yes,https://github.com/tsleng93/SchoolReopeningStrategies/tree/main/FittedModel,Yes,"We extended our existing stochastic individual-based model of secondary schools formed of year-group bubbles26, to quantify the level of pupil-to-pupil transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary schools in England from 31st August 2020 to 23rd May 2021, and assessed the impact of LFTs on pupil-to-pupil transmission from 8th March 2021 to 23rd May 2021.",Three or more different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Industry","Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Applied mathematics","1.

In the base case scenario, we assumed that vaccination continued with the average daily rate of 92 vaccine doses per 100,000 administered during December 2022.

Vaccination reduces the risk of infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease based on the efficacy of each dose in primary series (i.e., monovalent vaccination) and booster (i.e., monovalent or bivalent). Prior to September 15, 2022, booster doses were assumed to be monovalent vaccines. After September 15, 2022, all booster vaccines were assumed to be bivalent. An individual was considered eligible for bivalent booster if the time elapsed since last infection, or a previous dose of monovalent vaccines exceeded 2 months.

For the base case scenario, we simulated our calibrated model from January 1 to June 30, 2023 with a daily rate of 92 bivalent vaccine doses per 100,000 population, corresponding to the reported rate for December 2022 in NYC, in accordance with DOHMH data.",Yes,"Compared to the base case, the high-uptake scenario averted 88,274 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 77,097–100,342) cases, and prevented 2,917 (95% CI: 2,557–3,267) hospitalizations between January 1 through the end of June 2023.

We ran and averaged 500 independent Monte-Carlo realizations for calibration, fitting, and simulations of scenarios (Fig. 2). To generate 95% confidence intervals for the mean of simulated outcomes, we used a bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap method30 with 500 replications for the mean function. This nonparametric resampling method accounts for skewness by adjusting for asymmetrical resampling distributions. Specifically, we first calculated the difference in cumulative outcomes (i.e., cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths) between the high-uptake and the base case booster scenarios for each independent Monte-Carlo simulation. We then used these data points as averted outcomes and generated 500 samples by employing the BCa method to derive the 95% confidence intervals for the mean values of the averted outcomes in the original Monte-Carlo simulations.

481,Pham 2021,Interventions to control nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study,Consensus,Yes,"While COVID-19 vaccine rollout is underway, it is still unclear how they affect transmission and how their efficacy is affected by the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. We, therefore, explored the relative effectiveness of different infection prevention strategies for HCWs in hospitals in the absence of vaccination using an agent-based model of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",No,,Yes, Netherlands,Considered and imposed,"The agents’ health behaviors are imposed through scenarios and assumptions. 

Text: 
The remaining parameters did not change. These reproduction numbers incorporated the effects of typical (but not COVID-specific) infection prevention measures in the hospital. We will refer to the model parameterized with these reproduction numbers as the wild-type scenario. This scenario also assumed that HCWs use 90% effective PPE (i.e., 90% reduction in infectiousness) in COVID wards and isolate at home immediately upon symptom onset for 7 days, after which they return recovered to work.

Various intervention scenarios were compared to this baseline scenario.

Table 2 Overview of all simulated scenarios. The main characteristics of the scenarios simulated in our agent-based model are presented",General preventative behavior,"In this scenario, all HCWs used 90% effective PPE in all (non-COVID and COVID) wards. ",No,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Mesa,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Our study has several limitations. First, we assumed that transmission occurs solely via HCWs in the absence of a direct patient-to-patient contact pathway, as has been used before in an individual-based model of nosocomial influenza transmission [39]. Assuming similar transmission modes for SARS-COV-2, we consider this assumption reasonable for hospital settings in Western countries where direct patient-to-patient contact is rare. When this assumption is violated, our estimated impact of HCW-based interventions is likely to be overestimated. Second, we considered SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of symptoms and neglected other respiratory tract infections. Thus, real-life positivity rates of contact tracing may be lower than presented in this study. Third, while we have included age-specific hospitalization rates for patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 and different proportions of asymptomatic infections for HCWs and patients, we have neglected age-structure in our transmission model. A possible extension of our model would be the inclusion of age-dependent susceptibility and infectiousness parameters. However, since the considered interventions in our model are not differential with respect to age, we do not expect any impact on the relative effect of the interventions. Further, our HCW cohorting intervention scenarios assume the same degree of cohorting both for nurses and physicians. In reality, cohorting strategies are only feasible for nurses. A such, the estimated effect of this intervention is likely to be overestimated. Since the estimated effect of HCW cohorting was estimated to be small, we expect it to be even smaller when implemented in the real world. Moreover, the duration of contacts, SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, visitors or other ancillary staff, delays between symptom onset and isolation or delays between test application and test result were not included. Finally, while we identified one parameter set for which our model results fitted the available data well, it is possible that other parameter sets exist that would produce a comparable fit. We have not used formal fitting procedures to match our model results to the data given the large number of parameters. However, qualitatively, our conclusions were robust in sensitivity analyses to variation of the most important model parameters. While our model was developed using data of a large Dutch teaching hospital and of the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands, our results can be generalized to other hospitals with a similar structure and may be relevant for subsequent waves and future infectious disease outbreaks.

The model was fit on hospital data from the first wave in the Netherlands (February until August 2020) and assumed that HCWs used 90% effective PPE in COVID-19 wards and self-isolated at home for 7 days immediately upon symptom onset

Compared to baseline, PPE use in all hospital wards (assuming 90% effectiveness) reduced RE by 85% and absenteeism by 57%

Patients are assumed to occupy a hospital bed in a single room. HCWs (nurses and doctors) work in duty shifts

All infected individuals are assumed to be infectious following a time-varying infectiousness curve.

Assuming the mean generation time ω(τ) to be equivalent to the observed mean serial interval, we calculated the infectiousness profile by β(τ) = ω(τ)R.

We assumed the infectiousness to differ between asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, defined by βA(τ) and βS(τ), respectively

Asymptomatic individuals are assumed to have an infectiousness proportional to that of symptomatic individuals

We assumed no patient-to-patient transmission as patients are assumed to occupy single-bed rooms. Only HCWs in their asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase contribute to transmission. We assumed that the incubation period has a Gamma distribution with mean of 5.5 days [15].

Table 1 Parameter values for the agent-based model

We assumed that moderately and severely infected patients recover after 14 and 35 days, respectively [16].

We used the number of patients admitted to the UMCU for non-COVID reasons and their length of stay for the time period 2014–2017 and assumed a 50% decrease in admissions during the study period (Additional file 1: Table S1)

Based on a published meta-analysis, we assumed that a fixed percentage of 20% and 31% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients and HCWs, respectively, were asymptomatic (see also Table 1) [20].

This scenario also assumed that HCWs use 90% effective PPE (i.e., 90% reduction in infectiousness) in COVID wards and isolate at home immediately upon symptom onset for 7 days, after which they return recovered to work

Based on recent results for B.1.1.7, we assumed a 56% increase in transmissibility

We assumed a PCR test specificity of 100% and distinguished two scenarios for the test sensitivity: (1) a time-invariant perfect sensitivity of 100% and (2) a sensitivity increasing with time since infection with a maximum sensitivity of 93.1% close to symptom onset and declining afterward (time-varying sensitivity)

In the baseline scenario, HCWs were assumed to use PPE in COVID wards when attending to patients, but not during breaks or in other parts of the hospital. The baseline reduction factor (PPE effectiveness) was assumed to be 90%, which includes both perfect-use PPE efficacy and expected PPE use adherence level. We assumed that 95% of the HCWs work in the same ward as during their previous shift

This scenario represents the most optimistic scenario where both nurses as well as physicians are assumed to be eligible for cohorting to the same degree

If tested positive, HCWs were assumed to immediately self-isolate at home for 7 days.

For 2-day contact tracing, contacts were always tested assuming a time-varying test sensitivity

Exposed HCWs awaiting tests were assumed to wear PPE during contact with any patient and with other HCWs.

Since HCWs were assumed to immediately self-isolate upon symptom onset, we calculated R during pre-symptomatic (Rhcw S ) and asymptomatic states ðRhcw A Þ

We subsequently assumed the introduction of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 56% increase in transmissibility (based on B.1.1.7 data), resulting in RS = 1.95 and RA = 0.8.

When perfect sensitivity was assumed, screening every 3 days reduced RE by 63%, to 0.24. 

The maximum absenteeism percentages were 5.2% for HCW cohorting, 5.1% for regular screening with perfect test sensitivity, 8.6% for regular screening with time-varying test sensitivity every 7 days and 6.6% every 3 days, 4.0% for 7-day contact tracing with testing assuming perfect sensitivity, 3.6% for 2-day contact tracing with testing assuming time-varying sensitivity and 3.9% for 7-day contact tracing with testing assuming time-varying sensitivity

Sensitivity analyses show that our findings do not change significantly when the assumed PPE effectiveness is reduced to 70%. When PPE effectiveness is assumed to be as low as 50%, screening every 3 days with perfect sensitivity becomes more effective than PPE use in all wards",Yes,https://github.com/htahir2/covid_intra-hospital_model,No,,Two different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics","Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences, Mathematics (general)","Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical

Appearance rates of the 23 symptoms between the infected and un­infected populations were compared and we included seven in the model including fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, change in smell, change in taste and loss of appetite, since these discriminated the infected and uninfected residents well (SI Fig. S3). In this model, we only considered symptomatic individuals who became infected during the study period of May 19 to July 17, 2020, i.e. those who were tested negative in the first serology test but positive in the second, and showed at least one of the seven of symptoms between the two tests. 

the assumption that a dormitory room accommodates 13 individuals, 163 individuals share a floor and 1300 individuals share a block.

Furthermore, to account for the heterogeneity in proximity between the residents, we allowed infection rates to differ for residents in a different room of the same floor, and of a different floor of the same block, while assuming a uniform transmission rate from the source to two individuals residing in the same floor but different rooms, or in the same block but different floors, which adds some flexibility compared to a fixed functional form.

Limitations

Nevertheless, there are limitations worth highlighting. Not all resi­dents participated in the trial, and for ethical reasons no data was available on them. However, because we allowed the generation time distribution to be fit to the data, their omission may not have a sub­stantial impact on the inferences. Because the trial was conducted dur­ing a period of hard lockdown when residents were banned from leaving the dormitory except for medical care, the estimates do not reflect the situation when residents are subject to less onerous restrictions, and the specific arrangement of the dormitory, with en suite toilets, may make it an imperfect representation of outbreaks in dormitories with common bathing facilities. Furthermore, the study period coincided with a trial of prophylaxes, which may lower the infection rates relative to a popula­tion without such interventions, though the high attack rates on all five arms albeit reduced in two of them suggests this may not be a major limitation. We also did not have access to molecular typing data to confirm the actual transmission pathways and did not screen vendors, security personnel, healthcare workers or other individuals who may have been involved in some of the transmission pathways. Finally, although our study supports a policy of reducing the density of dormi­tories to increase residents’ resilience to infectious disease outbreaks, the trade-off between reduced density and increased costs will need to be taken into consideration in solving this policy question.

For our research goal, the Contained state serves the purpose of modelling those whose ability to spread is greatly reduced by means of personal containment measures, with respect to others without limitations (or only subject to a general social distancing policy).

Appendix B: Pre-infectious incubation testing",No,, ,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume) 
By assuming hypothetical configurations at the time of the re-opening decision and the partial knowledge concerning epidemic dynamics available to public health authorities, we have analyzed the risk of the re-opening decision based on possibly unreliable estimates.

By design, it is a mechanistic and imperfectly mixed model based on assumptions that are exploratory in nature and do not aim to be predictive (Holmdahl & Buckee 2020).

The assumption we made for state II is that it is infectious with a reduced viral load. Same assumption of reduced viral load has been made for state Mild Infected (MI), both at half the full viral load of state Acute Infected (AI). These are simplifying assumptions, based on medical reports (Li et al. 2020c; Longini et al. 2005), to account for heterogeneous transmission probabilities between agents.

We assume that all AIs certainly receive a diagnose within a time frame, and then move to state C.

Our base assumption is that individuals in state C do not transmit the infection to peers and move to recovery/removed (state R) according to a probability distribution within a time frame derived from the literature.

Table 1: Model’s states with description of characteristics and assumptions for simulations.

With regard to the infectious states, we make the assumption that in the final phase of the epidemic wave, information networks such as the press and generic public opinion makers, will be primarily influenced by the dynamics of the Acute Infected and the Contained classes, as recorded by official statistics, with risks brought by the mostly unknown Mild Infected class not well acknowledged.

As such, we assume that even in cases of temporary immunization, the rate of re-infections would not be particularly relevant in that time frame.

We then turned to our model and assumed that the number of active cases in COVID-19 statistics logically corresponds to our C state, because both are known measurements and relate to infected cases, officially recognized and treated, at a specific time (day, timestep).

This simplified assumption could prove acceptable for some real cases while being unacceptable for many others, since the variety of criteria and factors that influencing government a lockdown lifting decisions is huge and difficult to describe in a single metric.

However, knowing that the epidemic dynamic was similar between the Madrid region and Lombardy, we assumed the same proportion of active cases with respect to the total number of cases at re-opening.

As the reference epidemic size, we made the educated guess of considering an epidemic that at expiration would have infected 30% of the total population, and the corresponding transmission probability has been calculated as equal to 0.02. The results presented in this work are all based on this working assumption.

For states Mild Infected (MI) and Contained (C), instead, we assumed a normal distribution of time TMI and TC.

In assuming the accurateness of the reproduction number when a specific network structure is considered, however, a word of caution is appropriate, because it is a complex task with many subtleties that current available soware libraries, like the EpiEstem, do not typically account for.

Comparing the two estimates, it could be observed that the series for AI:MI=40:60 starts from higher values than the series for AI:MI=20:80 due to the higher incidence (a larger proportion of Acute Infected agents produces a higher incidence due to the assumption of reduced viral load of Mild Infected agents).

We assumed that a fraction of the Mild Infected (MI) cases is detected and thus moves to the Contained (C) state, rather than remaining in the MI state until the final transition to the Recovered (R) class.

p. to recover for an MI individual without being diagnosed and contained. We assume this case as non-existent.

Limitations
Our work also has many limitations, as it is inevitable for a model attempting to describe the context of the re-opening decision, when many different factors could possibly play an important role. We chose to focus on only a few aspects (i.e., the proportion of asymptomatic cases, possible variations through testing and containment and the duration of agents permanence in infectious states), while ignoring many others. For example, we did not take into account immunity and re-infection, limiting our analysis to the risk metric. We did not however include behavioural responses based on fear, awareness, or gregariousness, which may certainly play an important role in the final epidemic phase and produce different behaviour from a heterogeneous population.

The use of the Welch’s t-test, instead of the more common Student t-test, is suggested by the different variances of the samples tested, while a limitation of the results derives from the assumption of normal distribution of the Welch’s test, which is not verified in the MI and C time series, as the descriptive statistics demonstrate.

The first is that there is apparently no agreement on the appropriate time for moving from a initial phase of pure containment of the damage, to a phase when it is the trade-off between preventing the infections and restoring social activities the most challenging issue. The evidence from COVID-19 experience is that re-opening decisions depend on many contingent factors, that case-by-case may assume more or less relevance.

Despite this heterogeneity, for all there is a time when the decision to li the restrictions is considered and we have defined it final epidemic phase, giving a simple empirical definition that, with the many limitations that it has, was needed to define a metric of risk and confronting scenarios.

Indeed, our main point in considering different proportions of AI and MI agents is that it gives, indirectly, a measure of the uncertainty of the situation.

More specifically, we aimed at considering the factors possibly affected by large uncertainty at the time of the decision and influencing the risk evaluation and management in a sensible way. To this end, the current COVID-19 pandemic provides plenty of evidences of uncertainty affecting the epidemic dynamics, its defining factors, and the decision process regarding social restrictions, their enforcement and lifting."

Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimated that reopening for a four-month semester without any precautions will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40.7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1.9, 61.1), middle school teachers (37.2%, 95% CI: 4.6, 58.1) and elementary school teachers (4.1%, 95% CI: −1.7, 12.0).

We assumed that individuals were in the infectious class for up to 3 days prior to observing symptoms [35], during which time they did not reduce their daily contacts.

Briefly, assuming an initial R0 of 2.5 [37,38], we solved for b as the ratio between R0 and the product of the infection duration and the weighted mean number of daily contacts per individual during the pre-intervention period (electronic supplementary material, equation 2).

Using estimates from studies evaluating risk of symptoms by age [39], we assumed that 21% of infected individuals less than 20 years and 69% of infected individuals 20 years and older experienced symptoms [39]. Following previous work [39], we assumed a to be less than 1, as asymptomatic individuals may be less likely to transmit infectious droplets by sneezing or coughing [43].

Simulations were initiated on 17 January two weeks before the first known case [44], assuming a fully susceptible population seeded with a random number (range: 5–10) of exposed individuals.

We established initial conditions for these simulations by initiating model runs spanning a school-closure period, and then modelled the effect of reopening strategies under two susceptibility assumptions (children less than 20 years half versus equally as susceptible as adults) and two transmission contexts (high and moderate community transmission).

For all counterfactual scenarios, except those permitting non-essential community contacts, we assumed 50% of household members of symptomatic cases reduced their community contacts by 75% and their work or school contacts by 100% [34].

Masks were assumed to reduce both outward and inward transmission by ηi [48], where ηi represents the efficacy of the mask for individual i.

We therefore assumed age-dependent mask efficacy (15% for elementary students, 25% for middle school students, 35% for high school students, 50% for teachers/staff).

3.2.1. Assuming children less than 10 years are half as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic individuals have lower transmissibility
Assuming a ratio (α) of the transmissibility of asymptomatic individuals to symptomatic individuals of 0.5, and susceptibility of children under 10 years set to half that of older children and adults, we estimated that there would have been 1.98 (95% CI: 0.44, 2.6) times more cases of COVID-19 throughout the nine Bay Area counties between 16 March and 1 June than observed had all K–12 schools remained open (figure 3), corresponding to 13 842 (95% CI: 6290, 23.040) excess confirmed cases.

3.2.2. Assuming individuals less than 20 years are half as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and asymptomatic individuals have lower transmissibility
Under the assumption that all individuals under 20 years are half as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 compared with adults, school closures would be the least effective intervention when compared with workplace and social distancing strategies, avoiding an estimated 4179 cases (95% CI: 308, 10 583) and 202 deaths (0.26 deaths per 10 000 population, 95% CI: −1.25, 2.50) between 17 March and 1 June across the Bay Area.

3.2.3. Assuming equal susceptibility to infection across all ages and asymptomatic individuals have lower transmissibility Under the assumption of equal susceptibility to infection among all ages, the estimated impact of school closures quadrupled, from 4179 averted cases to 16 348 (95% CI: 8325, 25 363) averted cases, making school closures the most effective intervention.

Excess seroprevalence, hospitalizations and deaths associated with school reopening, as they varied with respect to differing assumptions about child susceptibility and community controls, are detailed in electronic supplementary material, tables S6–S9.

Assuming equal susceptibility across all ages In scenarios evaluating both moderate and high community transmission, when susceptibility to infection is assumed constant across all ages, we estimated a higher proportion of additional clinical infections among all sub-populations and reopening strategies than in the reopening scenario where children were half as susceptible (figure 5).

We compare modelling results across various assumptions of each but contact tracing studies that seek to capture the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of symptomatically and asymptomatically infected children across ages are urgently needed.

When schools are closed, we assumed that all students spend their schooling time at home. Masking is assumed to be able to reduce the infection risk by 85%.[21]

The sum of people infected in near and far fields is greater than the total number of secondary cases because we assume that being infected in these two fields is independent and one person can be infected in both fields. 

The degree of that difference, however, may be overestimated because we assumed that the viral density was independent of the particle size, but there is some evidence that the viral density is higher in particles less than 5 μm in diameter than in larger particles.[5]

Limitations (implied)

Hence, the version reported here should not be regarded as a “ready-to-apply” package, but as the basis to be updated and adapted locally if and when needed. For example, we assume the viral concentration to be the same in large versus small airborne particles, and recent information suggests that it may be higher in small particles, but by how much remains uncertain.[5] While this is a parametric issue, there also may be structural changes preferred by others or suggested by local circumstances.

Limitations

This situation led us to emphasize that the results of the simulations at any point were conditional, hence the “what if” terminology. This conditional caveat is a general aspect of modeling studies, but it takes on much greater relevance if the model to be used by public health authorities to explore interventions in the midst of an epidemic. In that context, our model has definite limitations, notably the issue of changing behavior on the part of the population as the epidemic progresses. For example, to what extent are people’s daily visits to the various environments changed or how does social distancing alter the near field/far field contact probabilities? Furthermore, but in a different dimension, the model only offers a snapshot of transmission occurring as a result of a single day’s exposure. While that was by intent in view of the time frame of public health decision making in a crisis, the model output offers only a limited view of the transmission dynamics.",No,, unclear,,One discipline,Life Sciences,Health Sciences,"Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States",No,,Calibration; Sensitivity analysis; Validation,"Model Calibration. We simulated the process of the synthetic population visiting different environments for 3.5 days, which is the average infectious period of COVID-19 cases, and recorded the exposure of any susceptible person in each environment category and to each initial case. These data were used to sample the infection status of each person and then to estimate the basic reproductive number R0, household secondary attack rate (HSAR), and dispersion parameter k of individual r0 by assuming that r0 follows a negative binomial distribution. To account for the stochasticity in the assignment of daily activities, environmental characteristics, and visits to environments, 10 repetitions were run for each parameter set. We used the general approach of regional sensitivity analysis[12] to identify sets of five parameters, sa, ci, k1, k2, and γ, from within the prior ranges listed in Table S1 that generated simulation results matching the calibration criteria, that is, lying within the predefined acceptable ranges of R0, HSAR, and k defined as the mean R0 of the repetitions ∈ [1.87, 4.5] (estimated from Modesto daily case time series data with the exponential growth rate method[13]), mean HSAR ∈ [0.15, 0.6],[14−16] and mean k ∈ [0.11, 0.64].[17] Randomly sampled 32 parameter sets that generated matching patterns were used in presenting the results and examining the “what-if” scenarios. As noted above, except for calibration, results are based on simulating only one day’s exposure of the synthetic population to reduce the computational time. Ten repetitions were run for each parameter set. Each of these repetitions has a different set of stochastically varying calibration parameters as well as the initial individuals infected, their pulmonary ventilation rate, their viral emission rate, their daily activities, and the physical characteristics of each specific environment.

Examining Determinants of the Number of Secondary Cases Caused by an Initial Case. A random forest (RF) model[18] was used to predict the number of secondary cases
caused by each initial case with their emission rate and number of contacts and to rank the importance of these two factors in the prediction. Eighty percent of the data from the simulations was used to train the model, while the remaining 20% was used to validate the model. 

Model Calibration and Validation. During the development of the model and its parameterization, there were three elements that required adjustment to be consistent with the broad patterns of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology reported in the literature, the distribution of the viral load in sputum, cv, x , which is the principal driver of the emission rate, En, and the susceptibility and infectivity of children relative to adolescents and adults. In the case of En, we began with a normal distribution in the calibration runs which resulted in a consistent overestimate of the HSAR, when R0 is in the predefined range. Subsequent reports made it clear that En was very likely to be overdispersed generally[22,23] and an adjustment to reflect these new data resulted in HSAR predictions that were consistent with that reported in the quickly expanding literature. The original assumption that the susceptibility and infectivity of children were the same as those of adults was clearly inconsistent with emerging epidemiological data showing lower susceptibility and infection rates in children in general.[9,11,24]

Fifty-five out of 100 sets of parameters randomly drawn from the ranges in Table S1 resulted in a mean R0, HSAR, and dispersion parameter k within the predefined ranges. All three outcomes are more sensitive to ci, while being less sensitive to the other four (Figure S1). To partially validate our model, we further compared the sex and age distribution of secondary case output by our simulation with the observed data for California[25] (Figure 1).

Text:
The parameters to be estimated include the length of the disease’s latent period (D number of days an individual is infective (D !9"" : E ), the I ), the probabilities that a contact leads to a transmission event (p t ), and the probabilities that an individual is quarantined at time t (q initial probability p 0 t ). They may also need to be estimated, but in many cases, this will be a known (small) number, such as 1/N for a single initializer. Given a contact graph, prior to social distancing and any intervention that may affect transmission probabilities, the quantities p KITE be related to the more intuitive reproduction number, or R 0 t may be defined to be the expected number of new infections generated by a given infective. This can be computed as R 0 $!#days infectious"" ) E!#contacts per day"" ) Prob!S % I contact leads to new transmission""; and hence p R 0 t $ D ! I d ; !10"" where ! d is the average degree in the contact graph A, i.e., the average number of neighbors in A. Estimation can be performed via ordinary least squares (OLS), i.e., minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed and the expected number of daily cases

We used ordinary least squares (OLS) to find a parameter by which we could multiply the deviations given in the Google Community Mobility Reports in order to obtain a daily estimate of the probability an individual would self-quarantine

We trained our model using OLS on the daily number of infections, estimating the effect of the lockdown as well as the effect of the face mask mandate; the latter of these was estimated as a rescaling of the transmission parameter.",Stay at home; Wear a mask,"We then computed the expected number of daily infections were the declaration of emergency to have occurred one week earlier and one week later than March 11; this was done by shifting the mobility data either backward or forward a week. We also considered the scenario where there was no declaration of emergency. We then evaluated the effect of replacing the
lockdown via the declaration of emergency with a face mask mandate for the dates March 4, 11, and 18. We additionally evaluated the effect of supplementing the lockdown with a face mask mandate, again for the same three dates. ",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Since the dates under consideration were so early in the course of the epidemic, we assumed that it would take some time before the same level of mask-wearing compliance as seen on April 15 would be observed. We therefore allowed the transmission rate to change smoothly from pre-mandate to post-mandate levels through a Gaussian kernel such that after ten days the transmission rate was 90% through the transition towards its final value.

Another important limitation that is worth noting with any study involving the effects of public health policy is the indirect link between behavior changes and policy. It is often impossible to fully disentangle the endogeneity of behavior changes, the size of the epidemic, and the timing public policy, when the counterfactual cannot be observed. It is likely that mask wearing, social distancing and self quarantine are also driven by personal precautions and would increase in absence of public policy mandates. Indeed, there is evidence that many behavior changes that resulted in social distancing preceded policy changes [83]. Thus, our results should be interpreted based on the assumed connection to behavior (e.g., the baseline, no intervention, case may not reflect actual behavior in absence of any policy).

Our method is limited in that some disease characteristics are simplified in exchange for more accurate contact patterns and computational efficiency. Specifically, it assumes that everyone who becomes infected experiences a constant latent period and is able to transmit the disease to their set of regular contacts (either directly or through the environment) for the same amount of time.

Our approach is limited in that in order to obtain credible or prediction intervals, simula tion would still be required.

One important point is the sensitivity of our results to two factors. First, we made all inferences based on a single network generated as described above. We checked and confirmed that there was negligible variation in our results based on using other networks generated according to the same mechanism. Second, we checked how the accuracy of our results fared due to the approximation used in (5). To do this, we compared the mean epicurve using our proposed method shown in Fig 2a to a Monte Carlo estimate obtained by simulation. We also compared the estimated curves in Fig 3a to Monte Carlo estimates. There was an apparent problem of scale during the peak of the epidemic, but the shape and conclusions drawn from the curves were the same for those from our proposed approach and the Monte Carlo estimates. See the S1 File for these and other sensitivity/accuracy results. Another important limitation that is worth noting with any study involving the effects of public health policy is the indirect link between behavior changes and policy. It is often impossible to fully disentangle the endogeneity of behavior changes, the size of the epidemic, and the timing of public policy, when the counterfactual cannot be observed. It is likely that mask-wearing, social distancing, and self-quarantine are also driven by personal precautions and would increase in the absence of public policy mandates. Indeed, there is evidence that many behavior changes that resulted in social distancing preceded policy changes [83]. Thus, our results should be interpreted based on the assumed connection to behavior (e.g., the baseline, no intervention, case may not reflect actual behavior in absence of any policy)"

Adapting the simulation models to integrate mobility matrices between provinces in post-lockdown Spain (see “Methods”), we compared epidemic spread under (1) “normal” travel behavior, assuming a continuation of observed baseline travel, (2) observed travel surge behavior following the lockdown announcement, and (3) a null model where mobility was calculated using a gravity model.

All three models assumed similar probabilities of overall travel as determined by the epidemic parameters and only vary the travel networks themselves.

Many simplifying assumptions were made in the simulation model for clarity, including homogeneous mixing within locations on the lattice, a gravity model for connectivity, and the inclusion of a single urban center. Additionally, we assumed transmission dynamics were the same between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and that symptomatic individuals stopped traveling immediately. We further assumed that increases in movement observed in the data following lockdown announcements were a reasonable proxy for increased contact rates, particularly in light of the anecdotal evidence of “panic buying”

We make the simplifying assumption that all non-urban locations are homogeneous in terms of size and density and only differ in their distance from the urban.

Asymptomatic and symptomatic cases are assumed to have the same beta, meaning the only difference between them in the model is whether or not they show symptoms.

The response of the population to the app warn ing is determined by the non-adherence parameter da∈[0,1] , which moderates the forthcoming contacts after the warning is received.

Once is related to the approximation of 1 agent corresponding to almost 1000 real individuals, making it difficult to recreate the early periods of the pandemic when the number of infected/deaths was still in the hundreds. Another limitation is linked to the mobility analysis. In this model agents move according to classes of distance, but a differentiation in terms of modes of transport has not been implemented (excluding very long distance trips which are considered as by plane). In this respect, future research might include the use of different modes of transport and assign to each of them a risk of infections, considering that collective modes have been considered riskier than individual ones, due to their potential crowding (e.g. see Barbieri et al., 2021).

Text: 
To model the current situation and the possibility of booster shots (perhaps in the Spring 2022 semester), we consider two different levels of vaccine effectiveness (50% and 80%) in our simulated scenarios. In our model, vaccination and antibody status impact agents’ susceptibility and infectiousness. Each agent is assigned the vaccinated attribute independently with probability V. Such agents have inward protection factor r i and outward protection factor r o . Vaccinated agents contribute a factor of 1 r o I of exposure time to susceptible agents in each meeting they are present at.

In line with most universities policies, all campus participants are required to be vaccinated. Accordingly, we set vaccine coverage to V=1.0in all scenarios depicted in Fig 1.

The second scenario ‘r = 0.5, Testing’ again sets r i =0.5 =r o Yo so , but includes weekly screening testing of 25% of the campus population

The third scenario ‘r = .8’ increases vaccine effectiveness to 80% compared to the first scenario so that r i =.80 =r o .

The assumption is implicit because we base our choice of R 0 on what occurred in universities for the 2020-2021 school year in which, to our knowledge, most, if not all, universities required facemasks in indoor public spaces.

Recall that our usual model assumes that facemasks are worn at all times in non-social settings

Each scenario assumes that 100% of the campus population is vaccinated.

Each scenario assumes that 50% vaccine effectiveness and considers different proportions V 2 {.5, .6, ..., 1} of the campus population vaccinated.

Our model typically assumes that individuals use facemasks while participating in campus activities. However, additional simulations suggest that facemasks are not necessary with 80% vaccine effectiveness and 100% vaccine coverage.

A limitation with our model is the difficulty with setting parameters. Another is in designing the contact structure and relative risk of different meeting types. Socializing plays a dominant role for infection spread in our model, but it is difficult to create a realistic contact structure. A novel aspect of our approach compared to other agent-based COVID-19 university models [7, 8] is that we use a Markov chain to create social groups matching students with similar characteristics (year and area of study). Our sensitivity analysis also includes scenarios with less socializing. On a different note, if screening testing is present on campus, then there is the opportunity for college administrators to respond in real-time to rising case counts. For example, moving to all remote instruction when a certain threshold is reached. For that reason, testing may be even more effective than our simulations suggest.

Our model has many simplifications that could be refined. We assume constant vaccine effectiveness. Recent evidence suggests that vaccine effectiveness decreases over time [43]. Thus, future modeling could include a time-component for vaccine effectiveness. It would also be more accurate to start with heterogeneous vaccine effectiveness in the initial population (representing different vaccination times for agents and also additional (booster) vaccinations.)

Transmission was evaluated for a range of observed local COVID-19 incidence (0-50 cases per 100 000 residents per day, assuming 33% of all infections detected). 

With student vaccination coverage of 70% or less and moderate assumptions about mitigation effectiveness (eg, masking), mitigation could only be reduced when local case incidence was 14 or fewer cases per 100 000 residents per day to keep the mean additional cases associated with reducing mitigation to 5 or fewer cases per month.

We used a previously published simulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within an elementary school community to generate estimates across a range of potential assumptions about intervention effectiveness, student vaccine coverage, and observed local COVID-19 incidence.16

SARSCoV-2 is introduced to the immediate school community at a rate proportional to the observed incidence rate for the wider local community (after accounting for an assumed case ascertainment rate).

(We assumed all members of a classroom are in-school contacts).

We assumed full-day symptomatic adult-to-adult in-school “secondary attack rates” (SARs) of 2%, 3.5%, and 7% per day for the wild-type virus, Alpha variant, and Delta variant, respectively (eMethods 1 in the Supplement).

We assumed that elementary students were half as infectious as adults in schools and equally infectious in household settings.16,32

In the base case, we assumed 70% uptake of 2-dose vaccination among adults (including educators, staff, and household members), reflecting US national data,45 along with 4 potential scenarios of student vaccine uptake (0%, 25%, 50%, and 70%).

Given recent observational data on waning vaccine effectiveness, we assumed a base case of 70% vaccine effectiveness,46-50 along with sensitivity analyses at 90%, 50%, and 25% effectiveness (eMethods 1 in the Supplement).

For each variant, we ran the model across a range of observed local incidence levels (0-50 cases per 100 000 residents per day, assumed 33% of cases observed) and in-school mitigation effectiveness (0%-100% reduction to in-school attack rate).

The hospitalization results were sensitive to the adult vaccination rate given that unvaccinated hospitalization risk is highest in adults and we assumed complete vaccine protection against hospitalization (a conservative assumption regarding the consequences of unmasking) (eFigure 2 and eTable 3 in the Supplement).

Limitations section
These results should be interpreted in the context of model limitations. First, several key data inputs were highly uncertain, including the effectiveness of individual mitigation interventions, proportions of all SARS-CoV-2 infections that are observed and reported, and hospitalization risks. To account for this uncertainty, we presented results across a range of mitigation effectiveness assumptions; incidence-based thresholds can be adjusted to reflect different proportions detected through simple multiplication (eg, to convert base-case assumption of 33% detection to 50% detection, incidence thresholds can be multiplied by 1.5); and the hospitalization rate objectives (eg, keep additional hospitalizations below 5 per 100 000 individuals per month) can be multiplied by similar conversion factors.",No,https://github.com/abilinski/BackToSchool2,Yes,"We used a previously published simulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within an elementary school community to generate estimates across a range of potential assumptions about intervention effectiveness, student vaccine coverage, and observed local COVID-19 incidence.16

Therefore, we model the population using eight categories of vaccine/ immune status: five vaccination states, immunity from vaccination and a natural infection, immunity from nat ural infection only and no immunity/unprotected

For each model iteration, an individual is determined to practice that risk mitigation measure or not, based on a random number draw. For example, in persons aged 30–39, 67% report limiting in-person visits to shops, 59% report using a face mask, 51% report avoiding public transport, 47% report working from home and 81% report using home testing kits. So, for a single model run for an individual aged 35, we draw a random number, i is the ‘receiv . say rand1 = 0.69, in which case this individual would not limit visits to shops or public transport use, or use a face mask, or work from home, but would use home testing kits. We assume a single number determines all risk mitigation measures for an individual, rather than choosing each of them independently, reflecting the evidence that some individuals tend to be more cautious than others in all their activities.

In an unconstrained epidemic, this reproduction number translates to approximately 35 (95% CI 34, 36) million infections.

With a 20% reduction in severity relative to the Delta variant, these numbers would be higher: 59,000 (95% CI 56,000–62,000) deaths (Fig. 2A–C). With 50% reduction in severity relative to the Delta variant leads to an estimated 225,000 (95% CI 216,000–236,000) hospital admissions and 44,000 (95% CI 42,000–46,000) deaths (Fig. 2E, F). With a 20% reduction in severity relative to the Delta variant, and no reduction in vac cine e ectiveness against severe disease, the estimated cumulative hospital admissions is 110,000 (95% CI 102,000–120,000) and the estimated cumulative number of deaths 20,000 (95% CI 19,000–21,000) (Fig. 2G–I).

With the high reported risk mitigation measures, seen across two cohort studies, we estimate that the Omicron effective reproduction number in England could be reduced to 1.9 (95% CI 1.8–2.2). relative to the Delta variant, and no reduction in vac cine effectiveness against severe disease, the estimated cumulative hospital admissions is 110,000 (95% CI 102,000–120,000) and the estimated cumulative number of deaths 20,000 (95% CI 19,000–21,000) (Fig. 2G–I). is reduced reproduction number equates to a 25% reduction in the number of infections to approximately 26 (95% CI 25–27) million cumulative infections, and a similar reduction in cumulative deaths to 34,000 (95% CI 32,000–35,000) (Fig.2C), under the assumption of 50% reduction in both severity of Omicron relative to Delta and 50% reduction in vac cine effectiveness against severe disease relative to Delta.

The main source of uncertainty in our modelled estimates is uncertainty in the severity of disease, both intrinsic severity (the probability of severe disease in a naïve, unvaccinated individual) and the probability of severe disease in individuals with prior immunity that suffer breakthrough infections.

453,Kim 2023,Heterogeneity is a key factor describing the initial outbreak of COVID-19,Consensus,Yes,"Hence, in this work, we investigate the impacts of heterogeneity in contact patterns on the basic reproduction
number by developing two distinct model frameworks: 1) an SEIR-Erlang ordinary differential equation model and 2) an SEIR stochastic agent-based model.",Understanding the role of ___,Contact or social network structure,No,,Yes, South Korea,Not considered,"Specific agent behaviors are not modeled, focus was more on contact patterns",,, ,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Like other studies, our work is not exempt from limitations. First, we employed the Erlang SEIR model, which was oversimplified for the actual dynamics of COVID-19. Since our main purpose is to estimate the R0 in the presence/absence of heterogeneity of contact patterns, we have used this rather simple SEIR-Erlang model. This ensures the consistency of both models with the same distributions for the latent and infectious periods. In addition, the delay effect of the latent period and infectious period can improve the accuracy of the fit to the epidemiological data of COVID-19 [25]. Second, there have been several variants emerged. During the first year 2020, Alpha variant was dominant and later on, several dominant variants including Delta and Omicron were emerged [45]. Also, vaccination have not begun until February 26, 2021 in South Korea. Since we have focused on the early outbreak of COVID-19, our model does not incorporate multiple variants nor vaccination. Third, we assumed the initial susceptible population size to be N = 100, 000 due to expensive computational cost of the agent-based model, although the entire population size of South Korea is over 50,000,000. Instead, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the number of susceptible individuals and it is confirmed that the distribution of the transmission probability converged as the population size gets larger. This can be further justified by one of properties of scale-free networks: the characteristics of the scale-free network are independent of the size of the network, as reported in [46]. Lastly, we constructed a scale-free network under the assumption that it is proportional to the infection network in the absence of actual empirical contact network of South Korea. This can lead to a coarse approximation of the actual contact network. Therefore, the estimated parameter can be improved to some extent by incorporating real contact structures. This is due to the fact that current complete social contact structures in South Korea remain unknown. Therefore, actual contact patterns should be investigated thoroughly for future emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases in South Korea.

Next, a scale-free contact network was constructed based on the empirical distribution of secondary cases assuming that contact patterns are proportional to the empirical infection-tree data of COVID-19

To highlight the importance of the contact structure, we employed two distinct model frameworks: 1) a generalised ordinary differential equation model with homogeneous contact assumption and 2) an agent-based model with individual variations in contact patterns

It is assumed that there is only one infectious individual in a completely susceptible population as the initial condition

We assume that infectious individuals are infectious for one time unit before being removed. Let Xi(t) be the random variable of the number of effective contacts with agent i on time [t − 1,t) and β0 be the probability that a contact with an infectious individual results in a new infection. We assume that an infectious individual remains infectious for a fixed period [t − 1,t) and also Xi(t) ∼ Poisson(β0ci(t − 1))

Hence, we generated a scale-free network, where the degree distribution follows the power-law distribu tion with a power of 2.8, using the algorithm provided in [39]. This is based on the assumption that the degree distribution of a scale-free network is proportional to one of the COVID-19 secondary cases estimated as a power of 2.8. In addition, we assumed the number of agents N = 100, 000 and a mean connectivity c = 12 (i.e. E[ci(t)] = c for each time t [40]). The generated scale-free network has the following properties: i) there are N nodes, and each node has no self-loop; ii) the minimum and maximum allowed degrees can be 1 and N − 1, respectively.

Therefore, assuming homogeneity of contact patterns could lead to inaccurate estimates of the transmission probability (hence, the basic production number) during the initial phase of disease transmission. In this study, we developed an agent-based model to incorporate more realistic contact networks to provide more accurate estimates of the transmission probability and the basic reproduction number in the initial phase of COVID-19 outbreaks in South Korea.

The trans-mission probability of the baseline model was 1.5 times more overestimated than that of the agent-based model. Hence, the basic reproduction number is 2.5 times more overestimated than that of the agent-based model (the mean is 6.68 vs 2.71)",No,,No,,Two different disciplines,"Engineering, Mathematics and Statistics",Applied mathematics,"Department of Applied Mathematics, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea

Moreover, as the population size increases, the results become very similar (Fig. 5 presents the results under the two population sizes N = 100, 000 and N = 120, 000)

Assuming the former is approximately 10–14 days and the latter is approximately 2–4 days, roughly 2–5 backward steps are theoretically possible.

We assume these mobility changes occur in the context of continued use of masks and other non-mobility-related NPI, which we estimate have together reduced transmission by roughly 10–15% (see Fig. 1e), which is consistent with roughly 40% efficacy31 coupled with 25–40% compliance.

We separated the effects of the first two components using detailed mobility data, and were therefore able to assess the impact of reopening whilst assuming that distancing, hand washing, and face mask use will continue.

People who were diagnosed and isolated were assumed to reduce their transmission rates by 70% for household contacts, and 90% for school, workplace, and community contacts. People who were contact traced and quarantined were assumed to reduce their transmission rates by 40% for household contacts, and 80% for school, workplace, and community contacts.

There are several limitations of this study. First, we do not consider geographical clustering or day-of-the-week changes in mobility, so cannot model hotspots or outbreaks in specific areas or on specific days. Although this may not be crucial given that interventions were set at a county-wide level, subsequent phases of the response may require more localized policy actions. Second, there is continued debate around how susceptibility and transmissibility vary by age and with comorbidities; the model parameters reflect the best available evidence to date36, but new evidence is continually coming to light. Third, there is considerable uncertainty around other crucial characteristics of both SARS-CoV-2 transmission (including the extent to which it is seasonal and the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission) and the impact of interventions (such as mask efficacy).",No,https://github.com/amath-idm/ controlling-covid19-ttq,Yes,Covasim,Three or more different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Industry","Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences","Institute for Disease Modeling, Global Health Division, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA, USA

PHSKC co-authors and other county officials have provided data, under use agreement, and insights on testing campaigns, focal outbreaks, schools, hospitalization, and congregate settings such as long-term care facilities (LTCF)",Verification; Calibration; Sensitivity analysis; Validation,"We aggregated line-list entries to daily totals by 10-year age bins to produce target data for model calibration. The resulting dataset includes the number of positive and negative tests (by date of sample collection), as well as the number of deaths (by date of death) in King County. The WDRS records also enabled us to characterize the distribution of delays between symptom onset on diagnostic swab; we used these data to validate the implementation of the testing intervention (Fig. 6). Using data on the number of tests and number of diagnoses, we were able to calibrate the model to testing yield

Calibration methodology. We calibrated model parameters using Optuna 2.0.0, a Python-based optimization library19, using the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) sampler5

We used 104,000 simulation runs during the calibration process to ensure broad exploration of parameter space.

Calibrating using four parameters was found to be sufficient to allow sufficient flexibility to capture observed epidemic trends, both with and without using mobility data as input.

The model was calibrated to data from 27 January until 9 June 2020. Scenarios began on 1 June 2020; we used the 9-day period of overlap to ensure consistency between calibrated and projected estimates of new infections, tests, diagnoses, and deaths

To verify the calibration, we excluded mobility data and recalibrated the model, f inding that relative transmissibility dropped by 71±3% compared to its initial value. All other parameters had consistent values between the two calibrations, including the change in transmission at LTCFs (estimated to have dropped by 80–92%) and overall transmissibility (estimated at 4.3–4.5% per household contact per day).

While zero delays were used here, we also ran a sensitivity analysis with nonzero delays (1 day for testing and 1–2 days for contact tracing).

Figure 5 shows that the model calibrated until 1 June 2020 was able to replicate observed epidemic trends over the next 3 months, providing validation that it is capturing the underlying transmission dynamics in Seattle, including the impact of the testing and tracing interventions on the epidemic",Yes,"As shown in Fig. 1, Covasim was able to accurately reproduce the detailed time trends of both diagnoses and deaths (Fig. 1a, b), including the age distribution of each (insets). We estimate that approximately 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% confidence interval: 80,000–115,000 infections) occurred in Seattle between 27 January and 9 June 2020 (Fig. 1c), out of a total population of 2.25 million, for an attack rate (cumulative infections divided by population size) of 3.5–5.1%. A total of 8548 cases had been diagnosed by June 9, for an overall diagnosis rate of 9% (95% CI: 7–11%). The effective reproduction number, Re, is estimated to have been 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0–2.6) prior to policy interventions, consistent with previous estimates20, and to have dropped below 1 as the shelter-in-place order took effect (Fig. 1d).

Di has just been determined as 8 days. R0 for COVID-19 epidemic of China has been estimated in several studies (Li et al., 2020; Liu, Hu, Kang, et al., 2020; Read et al., 2020; Sanche et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). It ranges from 2 to 6, with an average of about 3. Therefore, we set R0 = 3 here, but we will also do a sensitivity analysis under different R0 assumptions: the relatively mild (R0 = 2) and severe outbreak (R0 = 4). Parameter k need to be known.

The mean value of k is 29.45 (0.2), which means the average number of encounters per day for an agent is about 30 agents.

The simulation was repeated 100 times to balance the stochastic effect. The median value (of 100 simulations) of simulated herd immunity is 66.11%. It indicates that our model is validated since the simulated herd immunity is almost equivalent to the classical herd immunity threshold of 66.67% (1−1/ 0 0 R R, = 3). We also did a sensitivity analysis under different R0 assumptions: the relatively mild (R0 = 2) and severe (R0 = 4) outbreak. Each of these tests also had 100 simulations. The simulated herd immunity (Table 3) again is consistent with the classical herd immunity threshold, which further confirms that our model is convincing

An indicator of Moran's I statistics was further applied to examine the level of spatial heterogeneity. Moran's I statistics is commonly used to test whether an observed spatial clustering is formed due to chance. The values of Mo ran's I would be approximately between +1 and −1. The higher the value is, the stronger the spatial clustering is. Global Moran's” I of Figure 4 is 0.46 (p-value ≤ 0.05), indicating that there is a strong spatial heterogeneity of herd immunity. These evidences verify the Hypothesis 1 that ‘the herd immunity rate is spatially heterogeneous in a city when COVID-19 is spreading naturally

449,Shastry 2022,Policy and behavioral response to shock events: An agent-based model of the effectiveness and equity of policy design features,Consensus,Yes,"Set in the context of COVID-19 shelter in place policies, in this paper we present the COVID-19 Policy Evaluation (CoPE) tool, which is an agent-based modeling framework that enables researchers and policymakers to anticipate the relative impacts of policy decisions. CoPE is a hybrid tool combining an agent-based model that generates dynamic social and professional contact networks using geographically specific census data with an epidemiological model of the progression of the COVID-19 disease through agents.",Other challenges,"Domain specific innovation (health behavior, disease transmission dynamics, mobility, etc)",Yes,"With the CoPE modeling framework, we provide an additional tool for policymakers to use in the design of targeted strategies supporting disproportionately affected populations.",Yes,United States,Considered and self initiated,"To summarize, CoPE takes the census code for any geographic unit in the U.S. as an input parameter and implements the model using the household distributions for all block groups in that geographic unit. The result is a population model that can probabilistically generate agents with age, race/ethnicity, income, occupation, and household size attributes matched at the block-group level for any given location (city, county, metropolitan region, or state) in the United States.

Within any interaction, agents update their risk tolerance to be closer to the group mean of all participants in that interaction to reflect the influence of local social
norms (Fig 2).

Each agent’s progression through the disease is charted based on a compartmental epidemiological model (Fig 1, S1 Appendix) [71]. Agents then change their activities based on their disease status (Fig 3). Asymptomatically infected agents make no changes. Symptomatic agents forego any social interactions that they might otherwise have scheduled but continue to receive essential services. Hospitalized agents cease all interaction in both social and professional spheres. Recovered agents resume the activities that they engaged in pre-infection. Agents are aware of symptomatic agents in their social net-works and revise their risk tolerance down (i.e., become more risk averse) as this proportion grows (Fig 2).",Stay at home,"The interactions that generate exposures are partly governed by the policy context which varies based on the duration, timing, and targeting of a shelter in place (SIP) policy, and partly governed by the extent to which individuals comply with the policy. 

The policy context manifests through three policy decisions related
to SIP policy: timing, duration, and targeting–these aspects are discussed in greater detail below. Agents respond to the policy context by changing the degree to which they interact in professional and social spheres (Fig 1)In the professional sphere, policy determines which agents continue to interact as providers of essential services. In the social sphere, agents have the ability to determine whether or not they will comply with the SIP order by ceasing social interactions; those with the highest tolerance for risk choose not to comply with (i.e., “flout”) the SIP order (Fig 2).",Yes,"Realistic baseline and alternative SIP scenarios are derived from publicly available data describing SIP orders in different states [75,76]. ",Yes,Social norms/social contagion,Yes,"Interactions occur in both the social sphere and the professional sphere. Social interactions have the potential to expose other agents gathered at the same social “event.” Professional interactions take two forms: service provision and service receipt. Service provision potentially exposes other agents within the same profession, while service receipt potentially exposes those seeking services from a profession and the agent providing that service. Within any interaction, agents update their risk tolerance to be closer to the group mean of all participants in that interaction to reflect the influence of local social norms (Fig 2). Equations governing the risk tolerance updates and asymmetric probabilities of infection are detailed in S1 Appendix.",No,,No,,Yes,"With any interaction, agents update their risk tolerance which in turn affects their SIP behaviors.",No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"CoPE has several important limitations. First, while the parameters used to initialize the models are grounded in individual-level empirical data, the results in the baseline scenario are empirically validated at the pattern level as opposed to the point level [74].

A second limitation is related to the computationally intensive nature of ABMs. For a single scenario at population scale, we simulate a random sample of 458,484 agents over a series of 48 model runs. Statistically, this implies that the estimates produced by the model may not be robust at the agent level. However, the focus of our analysis is not on individual-level outcomes, but rather on aggregated, emergent, system-level outcomes [74]. At the system level (in our case the County level), the estimates are robust.

CoPE also is limited in that not all types of real-world interactions are included. We focus on professional and social interactions, which have consistently been reported as being responsible for driving the infections. 

One limitation of CoPE, in comparison to the other models, is the focus on a single type of intervention–SIP policy, whereas the Covasim and TRACE models include the ability to model different interventions [66,82]. Additional intervention types can be built into CoPE in the future, expanding the potential for analyses of both efficacy and equity.

In all scenarios we assume that within our simulation timeframe, even after the SIP order is terminated, the arts and entertainment industry would not return to full normalcy, educational instruction would continue to be online, and those in computer-related occupations would primarily work from home [80].

Both the agents themselves (input data) and the model components (operational modules) are empirically grounded. 

 During the first peak, the Austin, Texas MSA (metropolitan statistical area) reported 480 hospitalizations. However, since the Austin MSA is a five-county region including Travis County the hospitalization counts are not directly comparable. Establishing point or distributional validity would more direct comparisons to real world data in a specific context, however doing so would also closely tie CoPE to that context and erode the flexibility of the tool. Pattern validity is sufficient to drive relative comparisons between scenarios.

For any computational model, it is important to ensure that the validation of the model is performed at the appropriate level and for the intended purpose of analysis [81]. The objective of our model is to demonstrate the relative differences between different policy and behavioral configurations, rather than accurately forecasting the real-world estimates of a particular configuration. Therefore, we focus on establishing the pattern validity of our model and pay less attention to point validity [74]. Since these patterns emerge from heterogeneity embedded in the structure of the empirical inputs, which we do not change, the relative differences in patterns are likely to be stable and informative.",Yes,"When the policy design can vary simultaneously along multiple dimensions, interactions among design elements can produce synergies or tradeoffs that increase or decrease effectiveness of the policy. Questions involving these synergies can be difficult to assess. For example, what are the tradeoffs between a short duration SIP enacted early versus a long duration SIP enacted late? How do these impacts vary when the compliance level of the population changes? With increasing complexity of policy design and uncertainties in policy compliance, anticipating the outcomes become less straightforward.
         To investigate these tradeoffs, in stage two of our analysis we simulate the incremental and interactional effect of timing and duration of SIP under the three targeting and compliance scenarios respectively (here on referred to as the integrated scenarios).

446,Rypdal 2021,Modelling suggests limited change in the reproduction number from reopening Norwegian kindergartens and schools during the COVID-19 pandemic,Consensus,Yes,This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools.,Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",No,,Yes, Norway,Considered and imposed,"We ran model experiments with varying parameters, and for each parameter set, we carried out two experiments.

The transitions were smoothed using the hyperbolic tangent function and two characteristic transition times that were estimated as a part of the procedure.

Department of Community Medicine, UiT–The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway",No,,None,,Yes,"We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04–0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01–0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what has previously been estimated for influenza pandemics

We use a novel approach to infer results that remain robust under the uncertainties about SARS-CoV-2 virus dynamics.

The number of infectious individuals in the start of the simulations were taken to be 5000 and 300 in Oslo and Tromsø, respectively. This was roughly three times the number of confirmed cases in each city (at the time the simulations were set up) in order to account for unrecorded cases. Since our results concern changes in the reproductive number, and not the absolute number of cases, they are largely insensitive to the initial conditions.

The two runs in a pair were identical for the first 14 days, and after that they branched in two directions: one run where schools opened, and a second run with the same parameters, that continued with schools closed. Model parameters were resampled for each pair.

March 15 and April 20, and a third value, R(2), after April 20. The transitions were smoothed using the hyperbolic tangent function and two characteristic transition times that were estimated as a part of the procedure. Varying these five parameters, we minimized the square error (on a linear scale) between the time series of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Norway and the predicted number of hospitalized patients from the SEIR model.

Uncertainty was estimated by repeated addition of normal distributed noise to the hospitalization data and re-estimation of parameters. We used a noise with a standard deviation twice as large as the sample standard deviation of the difference between the optimal fit and the hospitalization data. Data on the number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was downloaded from The Norwegian Directorate of Health [5] on May 22. We note that number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Norway never exceeded 324, so limited hospital capacity did not influence the number of hospitalizations.

As a supplement to this method, we also applied a simple non-parametric method to the time series of confirmed infections in Norway, as well as in the cities of Oslo and Tromsø.

As will be shown below, we found that if in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to what is believed to be the case for influenza pandemics (r = 1), we estimated for Oslo ΔR = 0.10 (95%CI 0.04–0.16) and for Tromsø, ΔR = 0.14 (95%CI 0.01–0.25). This means that the most interesting range of R prior to school opening to explore is the interval 0.6–1.0. The result of such an exploration is shown in Fig 2. The three panels show the estimated R before April 20 and after April 27, assuming different values of R before April 20. The way we were able to assume different initial values of R, was that we weighted simulations by their estimated R values before April 20 using gaussian weight distributions centered around R = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively, with standard deviation 0.1.

The solid lines are the weighted medians, and the dashed lines show weighted 95% CI. A: The model ensemble for the city of Oslo weighted by a normal distribution with mean 0.6 and standard deviation 0.1 for the reproduction number prior to April 20.

D, E, and F: As (A-C), but for the city of Tromsø

Since the magnitude of R prior to school opening is only known with considerable uncertainty (S1 Fig), these prob abilities are also associated with great uncertainty, but their magnitudes still provide an indication of the risk for a second wave of infection associated with school openings.

The variation in ΔR in Fig 2 was mostly determined by variation in the relative in-school transmission rate r. We found the relationship between ΔR and r to be approximately linear over the set of simulations with different parameter, and for both cities. We estimated ΔR = 0.10 r for Oslo, and ΔR = 0.14 r for Tromsø (Fig 3 and S3 Fig). The standard errors were 0.004 for 0.10, and 0.005 for 0.14

Another objective of this study was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. The simulations show that we are not able to make such inference. The main reason for this is that the linear relationships between ΔR and r have small proportionality factors (0.10 and 0.14), implying that uncertainty of in-school transmission rates is amplified relative to uncertainty in ΔR (.). In order to constrain in-school transmission rates from the change (or lack of change) in R in Norway, we would need to estimate ΔR with significantly higher accuracy than we can obtain from currently available hospitalization data using SEIR models (Fig 4), or from non-parametric estimation methods of R (S1 Fig).

C: The distribution of the estimated change in reproduction number after April 20.

Our model results suggest that the controlled opening of schools in Norway will lead to a change in R of less than 0.25, and most likely in the range 0.10 to 0.14. This holds true despite the uncertainty about the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Since Nor way had strongly suppressed the COVID-19 outbreak by the middle of March, a change in R of the order of 0.10 to 0.14 will not have had a strong effect on the number of infections. A strength of our study is that the estimates are robust under a wide range of assumptions about transmission rates and reflect changes in the contact networks associated with school openings.

There is uncertainty in the reference value for in-school transmission rates [18], but our results show low sensitivity to the transmission rates. The model results for the city of Oslo show a change in the R less than 0.25, even for in-school transmission rates which is 20% higher than the influenza reference value"

Another possibility could be its use in Low and Middle income countries: the key ingredients that would permit this are the availability of contact matrices from the work of Prem et al.

Another possibility could be its use in Low and Middle income countries: the key ingredients that would permit this are the availability of contact matrices from the work of Prem et al. [23] for almost all countries worldwide, the assumption that age-dependent susceptibility does not depend on anything other than age, and similarly the assumption that the IFR of COVID-19 derived from the Spanish data could be exported to other countries.

We assume in our model that: i) infections that are not detected and those cases detected but not under active surveillance have the same effective reproduction number (R) and therefore on average, infect the same number of secondary cases; and ii) AS have a lower effective reproduction number (scaled by α) because they are rapidly isolated after the onset of symptoms.

For each run of each scenario, we sampled 10,000 values from [0, 1]2 uniformly for (π, α), which is comparable to assuming a uniform prior distribution, and computed the other parameters (γ, φ, μND) if a solution was viable.

Here we assumed prior knowledge about the values of π and α so uniformly sampled between 0.2 above and below the true values of π and α (see SID for parameter value).

We also undertook a sensitivity analysis to investigate relaxing our assumption on α, where we compared the estimated values of missing cases when we varied the reduction in the scaling for a NAS case.

We estimate that only 5.26% (95% CrI: 0.245–16.0%) of cases were not detected during this wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in NZ (see Table 1 for all parameter estimates) assuming surveillance targets were met, which would correspond to a well-functioning and rigorous contact tracing and surveillance system in NZ.

This is a limitation of the method but could be improved with better understanding of the performance of the routine surveillance (π) and changes in transmissibility due to contact tracing status (α), which would narrow the region in the parameter space.

Assuming vaccine distribution is uniform, we found that vaccination and NPIs were associated with reduced infections, hospitalizations, and deaths across racial/ethnic groups and rurality, whereas no scenarios appeared to be substantially associated with reduced disparities in these outcomes.

Our findings are conditional on our modeling assumptions and specification of vaccination and NPI scenarios. Notably, in our simulation, vaccination protected individuals from infection in an all-or-nothing manner (ie, a proportion of susceptible individuals transition to the recovered state), although partial protection could be more realistic.48

Finally, our model assumed immunity due to vaccination or recovery from natural infection was permanent.

Limitations section
In addition to the modeling assumptions discussed above, there are notable limitations to our study. The unique characteristics of North Carolina, including demographic characteristics, prevalence of diabetes, rurality, mobility, and adherence to NPIs, are associated with the transmission of SARSCoV-2 and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. General insights into the effect of vaccination and NPIs may apply to other states or regions, although exact numerical values will vary. The broad age category (20-64 years) limited age specificity of outcomes among adults. Demographic attributes (eg, age and race/ethnicity) within tracts were assigned independently, and interactions were not fully captured. Although our model projections followed major state-level counts and trends in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, they did not capture all variability in reality, either over time or within subpopulations.

Limitations
However, we must still be aware that it contains several inherent limitations. First, high variability in country-specific COVID-19 statistics is observed [65], which can be accounted for by several factors like demography, pool of asymptomatic cases, and the health system structure. Solving this problem of unbiasing data is still an open issue and is particularly important for the development of epidemiological models as well. Second, the spreading of infectious diseases and human behavior are intertwined and is, particularly in the case with the SARSCoV-2 virus, gradually affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are calling for a coordinated international strategy [70,71], as well as by endogenous reductions of social interactions [14,72,73]. Our study included this aspect in a very simplified form, i.e., by affecting contact rates by the number of symptomatic infected individuals and hospitalized individuals. This relation is, in reality, much more complicated and can result in diverse epidemic trajectories [73,74]. Third, while our model accounts for human population heterogeneity, our representation which considers a three-tiered subpopulations scheme with different systemic metabolic disturbances, is very simplified. Not only that in reality, the immunological and health heterogeneity of the population is much more complex and connected with the socio-demographic structure, but also the extent of social engagement depends on the health status of individuals, which is not considered directly in our model [75]. Fourth, in our simulations we have used a rather small and isolated social network with 105 nodes, which warrants only a qualitative description of the COVID-19 spread but cannot account for the diverse epidemic patterns observed in different regions around the globe [76]. Fifth, we have considered only two fixed vaccination rates, one high and the other low, which is a simplification of the actual changeable delivery patterns observed in most of the countries. Adjusting an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration with respect to the limited supply in the real-world situation is a very complex process [37,38,41,42,77], but this is beyond the scope of the present study. Finally, there are, of course, several other aspects to consider when modeling the behavior of spreading dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, such as more complex vaccination strategies, mutations of the virus, how strictly a population is following preventive measures, etc., but currently, the major open issues are the uncertainties of immune periods [78–80].",No,,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Engineering, Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Industry","Electrical, Electronic, and Communications Engineering, Health Sciences, Applied mathematics","1 Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia

Model assumptions section
The model assumes, based on calibration, that average adult OOHA levels were reduced after Chicago’s March 21, 2020 stay-at home order to 57% (SD 8%) of pre-COVID-19 activity levels.

During the summer, we assumed that school-age children (age <18) engaged in peer-to-peer activities at a 50% lower rate than activities during the typical (prepandemic) school year.

All scenarios assume that school-age children engage in protective behaviors inside and outside of school.

Limitations section
Our results reflect Chicago’s local epidemic, and may not generalize to other places, though similar modeling approaches could be applied elsewhere to understand how protective behaviors in various population subgroups impact transmission dynamics. The results should be interpreted in light of the model assumptions that if altered could produce different results. For example, we assumed that protective behaviors were maintained among children while at school. This assumption appears plausible given that children’s behavior in school is closely monitored and peer-to-peer interactions are relatively constrained, making it easier to enforce protective measures.

First, the model ignores the impact of social networks in

Second, an important assumption is that all deaths due
to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified and re-
ported (e.g., no deaths under the status quo scenario oc-
curred before admission to the health-care facility).
Third, we assumed that post-infection immunity com-
pletely protects again reinfection over the duration of
simulations. Fourth, we assumed that all deaths occurred
in the ICU. Notwithstanding, the effect of this assump-
tion on our projections is likely to be marginal, since the
simple-bed mortality is relatively low and no deaths out-
side the hospital system have been reported [5]. The above was supported also by analyses from Euromomo
that showed that overall mortality in Cyprus remained
within the expected range [34]. Fifth, due to the relatively low number of COVID-19 related deaths during
the first epidemic wave, the model does not capture the
initial numbers of deaths very precisely. Finally, in the
counterfactual scenario, public health interventions were
removed, while assuming that everything else remained
exactly as in the status quo scenario, i.e., there would be
no changes in the duration that a patient stays in an

If Cyprus had not implemented any public health measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 14th. The interventions averted 715 (95% CrI: 339, 1235) deaths.

Every day, susceptible individuals might contact infected people and enter the exposed disease state before they become infectious. Infectiousness may start at least 1 to 2days before the onset of symptoms [2, 14, 15]. Asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms could recover from the disease after 5–7days [16, 17].

The validity of estimates from modeling studies depends on the quality of the data to which models are calibrated

Specifically, transmission rate, proportion of patients who would need hospital care or ICU, and effect of NPIs were varied until the model reproduced the observed trajectories.

The IAR was estimated using as numerator the number of total infections obtained from the model by May 8th and as denominator the total population of the Republic of Cyprus. The IFR was estimated using as a numerator the number of reported COVID-19-related deaths and as a denominator the number of total infections obtained from the model by May 8th. Finally, the CAR was estimated using as numerator the reported cases by May 8th and as denominator the number of total infections obtained from the model. For each scenario, 1000 runs were performed. The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles were also shown to include the appropriate uncertainty (stochastic variability). To measure the accuracy of the model’s prediction against the observed data, the least square method was used (i.e., minimizing the square distance between observed and modeled data).

ICU-only scenario If only ICU beds had increased from 27 to 50, the healthcare system would have lasted only 5 days longer from being overwhelmed, compared to the counterfactual scenario (Fig. S7). Under this scenario, the computed COVID-19-related number of deaths would be 58 (95% CrI: 40, 75) by May 8th (Fig. S8a), and the estimated deaths due to the nonavailability of an ICU bed would be 615 (95% CrI: 270, 1080) (Fig. S8b). Thus, if only ICU bed capacity had improved, the expected number of deaths would be 673 (95% CrI: 310, 1160) by May 8th, 2020.

According to our model estimates, the implemented public health measures averted 715 (95% CrI: 339, 1235) deaths."

A step by step approach for building such a model for another region can be found in [7]. The methodology began by generating the individual people according to the U.S. census data that gives population attributes including age (see Table  A1 in [7]) and occupational distribution (see Table A4 in [7]). Thereafter, it generated the households based on their composition characterized by the number of adults and children (see Table A2 in [7]).

On the first day of the simulation, the model introduced a few initial infected cases in the community and began the social mixing process. Each day the model tracked the following for each person: 1) hourly movements and locations based on their daily schedules that depend on age, employment status, prevailing social intervention orders, and quarantine/isolation status; 2) hourly contacts with other susceptible and infected; 3) vaccination status and immunity, 4) force of infection accumulation; 5) start of infection; 6) visits/consultation with a doctor (if symptomatic and insured); 7) testing (if infected and visited/consulted a doctor or asymptomatic chosen for testing either randomly or via contact tracing); 8) test reporting delay; 9) disease progression (if infected); 10) hospitalization (if infected and acutely ill); and 11) recovery or death (if infected).",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Wear a mask;  contact tracing,"The study developed a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under various social interventions including full and partial closures, isolation and quarantine, use of face mask and contact tracing, and vaccination.",Yes,"Published data from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard was used to validate the model

percentage of asymptomatic among infected (assumed to be 35% [32])

For the susceptible, if vaccinated, since the exact immune response from vaccine was not known at the time of the study, we assumed a linearly increasing partial immunity for susceptible after they received the first dose, attaining full immunity after 7 days after the second dose; we only considered vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, for which the second dose was administered 21 and 28days after the first dose, respectively.

The model assumed that the recovered cases became fully immune to further COVID-19 infections. 

Asymptomatic cases were assumed to follow a similar infectiousness intensity profile but scaled by a factor Ck, as used in the force of infection calculation (1) (see Table A4 in Additional file 1).

Each susceptible was assumed to ingest viral particles from each infected they come in contact with during the day. 

The daily force of infection was considered to accumulate. However, it was assumed that if a susceptible does not gather any additional force of infection (i.e., does not come in contact with any infected) for two consecutive days, the cumulative force of infection for the susceptible reduces to zero.

Based on the government contracts at the time of our study, we assumed availability of an estimated 2.54 million doses for Miami-Dade County to inoculate 1.27 million people (among the total population of 2.8 million) on a 2 dose regimen.

We also assumed that vaccination of all priority groups occurred 
uniformly over the eligibility periods considered, which may not reflect the reality. Also, at the time of the study, there was little available literature on the rate of immunity growth each day from the two dose vaccines, therefore, we assumed a linear growth starting with the 
first dose and culminating (full immunity) 7 days after the second dose.

Since we did not track health conditions in our AB model, we 
limited our priority 3 to people of ages 65 and above only.

Though our AB model is well suited to study future progression of COVID-19 and other similar respiratory type viruses, it has some limitations. The simulation model is highly granular, which while being a strength presents a challenge of appropriately estimating the wide array of its input parameters.

Model calibration section

We kept almost all of the above parameters fixed at their respective chosen values and calibrated the model by changing values for only a few. The calibrated parameters include the transmission coefficients used in calculating force of infection at home, work, school, and community places (βh and βj p) (see Table A4 in Additional file 1).

The only other parameters that were calibrated are the number of errands in the daily schedules under various intervention conditions and the percentage of workers in essential (e.g., healthcare, utility services, and grocery stores) and non-essential (e.g., offices and restaurants) workplaces who physically reported to work during different intervention periods (see Table A1 in Additional file 1). Calibration of the above parameters was done so that the daily cumulative numbers of reported infected cases from the AB simulation model closely matched the values published in the Florida COVID-19 dashboard until December 30, 2020. 

The model was calibrated using transmission coefficients and parameters guiding the daily schedules of people, and was validated using the actual reported cases from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard till December 30, 2020 (see Fig. 4).

Though we have attempted to address this challenge by conducting a sensitivity analysis on some of the critical parameters, such as levels of face mask usage, contact tracing, societal closure, and school reopening, this analysis could be extended to many other parameters",Yes,"The AB model also included a number of uncertainties such as 1) time varying values of testing rates for symptomatic and asymptomatic, test sensitivity, and test result reporting delay (see Table  A9 in [7]), 2) self-isolation compliance for symptomatic cases and quarantine compliance for susceptible household members (see Table  A10 in [7]), 3) time varying and age specific probabilities of ‘hospitalization among reported cases’ and ‘death among hospitalized’ (see Tables A2 and A3 in Additional file 1), 4) mask usage compliance (100% compliance was assumed to reduce transmission coefficient by 33% [26]), 5) contact tracing level (assumed to be at 15% based on [27, 28]), 6) percentage return to school (considered to be 50% based on [29]), 7) willingness to vaccinate (considered to be 60% based on survey results in [30, 31]), 8) variations in daily schedules during various phases of social interventions (see Table A5 in [7]), 9) percentage of asymptomatic among infected (assumed to be 35% [32]), and 10) vaccine efficacy (95% [3])."

Text: 
In this paper, we present an agent-based model that reflects the complex interplay between the spread of a pathogen and individual protective behaviors under the influence of media messaging

We use the Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning for the growth and extinction of fear, a factor that has been proposed as a major contributor in the determination of protective behavior

The influence of media in the form of messages promoting protective behavior is negligible in the model.

The model represents the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in an exemplary German city, Aachen. It incorporates infection an agent modeling insights with mechanisms for behavior change based on information

The media aspect is realized in the form of messages to the population that communicate behavioral guidelines, acceptance rates, and the progress of the epidemic.

Several factors influence the risk of infection between agents. The main factor is the protective behavior of an agent, which decreases the risk of infecting others (as quantified by Chu et al. 2020) by adopting health protective measures like wearing masks, keeping a safe distance and regularly washing hands. Behavior also influences one’s decision to partake in social activities, where agents with active behavior are more likely to skip these interactions. Furthermore, agents can choose to reject to self-isolate and therefore risk infecting others based on their behavior.

The behavior model is composed of three main components: social norm, attitude and fear. Attitude is the base attitude towards protective behavior, which is determined by trust in the health care system and demographic factors. Fear models the perceived risk the infection poses to the agent and his surroundings. Social norms represents the average behavior of other agents in the same nodes.

The fear factor is based on the number of reported daily cases and infected acquaintances of the agent. The total number of daily infections is divided by the total number of agents for normalization. This approach is derived from the cumulative incidence as used by Badham & Gilbert (2015), and is also supported by Murray & Schaller (2012), which find that the cumulative incidence of infections is linked to behavior and conformity. The second component, infected acquaintances, is linked to the local incidence of the infection, which influences the perceived fear (Badham & Gilbert 2015). Here, the growth of active cases in the personal environment (adjusted by a correction factor) is used since now agents directly experience the infections. We model fear as only dependent on local information (infected acquaintances) and global information (new cases per day), as seen in Funk et al. (2010)",Stay at home; General preventative behavior,"The main factor is the protective behavior of an agent, which decreases the risk of infecting others (as quantified by Chu et al. 2020) by adopting health-protective measures like wearing masks, keeping a safe distance and regularly washing hands... Furthermore, agents can choose to reject to self-isolate and therefore risk infecting others based on their behavior.",Yes,"Table 1: Model parameters and state variables

The adoption of protective behavior is based on Blom et al. (2020), which shows peak protective behavior on the 16th March 2020 and slow decay afterwards. Since this data is not detailed enough, we complemented it with the mobility data as compiled by Apple (2020). The shown trend matches Blom et al. (2020) and additionally provides detailed data on a day-to-day basis. The time series is inverted from ""activity levels"" to correspond to the growing adoption of protective behavior. The fear trend of the population is based on a web survey by YouGov (2020b), which depicts the levels of high or very high fear regarding COVID-19",Yes,"Rescorla-Wagner model, With a conceptual model of cognition",Yes,"The second component, infected acquaintances, is linked to the local incidence of the infection, which influences the perceived fear (Badham & Gilbert 2015).

The agent responds to stimuli (events) that (may) trigger fear or other feelings and shape the agent’s behavior. The strength of association of a feeling to a stimulus determines the strength of the response. A stimulus may be the experience of a criminal act, the infection of a person, or the sudden drop in the price of an index
stock. ",Yes,"Several factors influence the risk of infection between agents.

Based on the trust in the health care system (YouGov 2020a), attitude is modeled as a normal distribution

Together, the factors attitude, fear and social norms provide a balanced threat response. However, a central issue identified with common threatmodels is the linear growth offear with infections. To address this problem, the approach of bounded growth and half-life extinction as presented by Epstein (2014) The multiplicands 100 and 2.2 are used for scaling and fitting respectively, resulting in an output range from zero to 220, meaning that fear can grow up to 120% per day. To prevent overshooting, the resulting fear level is averaged over a calibrated value of the last six days

As additional, objective measurement, Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Average Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used. The MAPE is prone to too much sensitivity for small values, which is balanced by the MAE which favors a prediction with correct Median, and the RMSE which better captures intermittent peaks (Vandeput 2019)

We use a t-Test (Welchs’s t-Test for unequal variances) when comparing model results for similarity as recommended by Lee et al. (2015). For the comparison to real world data, we use face-validity and the observed measurement errors (ME). The model infection trend is therefore compared with (adjusted) real world infection data. 40 model runs are computed for each configuration and the results bootstrapped (5000 samples) to improve the estimates and calculate reliable confidence intervals

The adjustments increase the model fit in terms of error measures, but lead to some undesirable macro-effects, namely high-frequent oscillations in the infected count that are not present in the empirical data. Figure 6 shows the cycle of mutual influence of the model factors.

To mitigate these undesirable effects, fear was averaged over a window of six days in order to reduce the volatility of this variable. This was based on Epstein (2014) who also used a moving average computation for fear. Furthermore, the impact of behavior on infection risk was reduced (from tenfold to threefold). Even though this slightly decreases the fit with the empirical data, we reduce the problem of over-fitting and the model generalizes to other contexts much better
Specifically, the fraction of infected agents is at 7% on day 25, 29% on day 50, 49% on day 75 and it rises up to 86% by day 100. The MAPE is very high (MAPE = 1173.63) due to a large discrepancy in the beginning, the other MEs indicate a good fit (RMSE = 0.13, MAE = 28%).

Subsequently, the infection spreads slowly and breaks out again  after day 75 with steadily high growth rates between days 30 and 112 (mean K = 0.027). With the infection-curve adjusted, this results in MAPE = 1196.9, RMSE = 0.25, MAE = 98%

The growth rate stays continuous after day 40 (K ⇠ 0.2) and the first noticeable inhibition of spread occurs at day 30, with a subsequent gradual growth afterwards. The fit according to the error measures is worse than for AC1 (MAPE = 374.84, RMSE = 0.42, MAE = 47%).

Regarding fear, the levels rise sharply after day 20, reaching their peak at day 35 with a subsequent slight decay. This corresponds well to the empirical data (MAPE = 9.44, RMSE = 0.08, MAE = 8%). Behavior yields a similar curve as fear, but with a slight delay and a lower peak after which there is, as for fear, a slight decay. Even though this conceptually satisfies the expectations, the fit with the empirical data is lower for behavior than for fear (MAPE = 40.1, RMSE = 18.18, MAE = 22%)

In the district of Aachen, fear and behavior curves show weaker initial growth and less pronounced decay than in the city of Aachen model (AC1). The general trend of both curves is face-valid with MEs for fear slightly lower (MAPE = 17.95, RMSE = 0.16, MAE = 16%) than behavior (MAPE = 36.29, RMSE = 0.16 and MAE = 21%). For both fear and behavior, large confidence intervals are produced. This indicates lots of variance between individual model runs. Variance is reduced substantially in later stages of the simulation. 4.22 For the simulation in the district of Rostock (see Figure 24 in the Appendix), both fear and behavior are significantly lower and show decreased fit to the empirical data (fear: MAPE = 49.24, RMSE = 0.81, MAE = 56% / behavior: MAPE = 69.22, RMSE = 1.12, MA = 47%). T

Next, we will compare the BFG model with the TELL ME model in terms of their explanatory power with regard to simulated epidemics. The performance will be evaluated in terms of the measurement errors introduced earlier

The performance of the TELL ME model is worse than the BFG model in several regards. The resulting behavior (MAPE = 219.28, RMSE = 0.57, MAE = 50%) as well as the resulting infections (MAPE = 710.29, RMSE = 0.16 and MAE = 36%) have worse fit with the empirical data than the BFG model. Infections grow slowly but consistently and they are not inhibited by protective behavior: The growth rate from day 25 to 100 is steadily declining (day 25: 0.12, day 120: 0.004), the infection rates overall are low as well.

Overall, the results are less realistic and produce higher MEs for behavior and infections when the TELL ME model is applied. The curves differ significantly from the BFG model

The MEs of the infection spread are similar to a regular run with individual behavior (MAPE = 1093.10, RMSE =0.12, MAE = 29.32%). However, the eventual infection count is lower than in the BFG model, with 10% fewer infections both on day 75 (39%) and on day 100 (71%), which also results in an overall slightly lower growth rate

The comparison of both configurations exposes only minimal differences with regard to infection, fear and behavior curves. The infection curve without media messaging has a similar fit with the empirical data (MAPE = 920.56, RMSE = 0.12, MAE = 11%) as the one where media messaging is applied. The same is true for the infection growth rate: It exhibits a similar trend (K = 0.2 for day 40 to 120) as in the model with media messaging. The cumulative infections without messages are slightly lower than with messages (84% at day 100 compared to 81%). Here however, the confidence intervals overlap. The most noticeable difference between both models is the higher variance in the model without messages (see Figures 25 and 26 in the Appendix)

All differences seen in the model with media communication are within the confidence intervals of the regular model.

Firstly, as fear itself is decreasing, are the other factors (i.e., norms and attitude) still sufficiently predicting behavior? Because the model only captures the initial phase of the pandemic, it is possible and even likely that other factors and behavioral drivers have emerged as the pandemic has progressed. "

In the model the effect of vaccination is captured at the individual level, where a certain percentage of fully vaccinated individuals “move” from a susceptible state to an immune state 

The effectiveness of a particular vaccination strategy was determined by running model software after adjusting vaccination settings for alternative coverage levels and vaccination ages. Seeding infectious individuals into the model initiated a COVID-19 Delta outbreak in a COVID-19 naive population that had been vaccinated to a given coverage level

A value of 33% was chosen to reflect a high proportion of cases with mild symptoms and a moderate/low level of testing and isolation compliance",Stay at home; Get vaccinated,"Results are presented for vaccination scenarios under alternative vaccine coverages, varied from 70 to 90% in individuals in two age categories: 5 and above, and ages 12 and above. We also consider activating moderate physical distancing, non-pharmaceutical (NPI) measures when Delta cases first appear in a community. These
correspond to the Stage 3 measures adopted by the State of Victoria, Australia, in 2020 and 2021, estimated as 20% workplace non attendance and 60% community contact reduction [8], altered to include schools remaining open. This is termed moderate NPIs in Table 1. Strict NPIs in Table 1 correspond to Victoria’s Stage 4 lockdown measures.

The rapid activation of strict physical distancing NPIs involving substantial economic, educational and societal disruption with schools closed (as de-fined in Table 1) is shown in Table 2 to substantially
reduce the disease burden of highly transmissible COVID-19 variants such as Delta, R0=6.0. The use of moderate, less economically disruptive NPIs with schools remaining open, can be seen to be effective in reducing the health burden when compared to relying on vaccination alone, i.e. without activation of NPI measures.

In the absence of physical distancing measures (Fig.1A, C), a vaccination strategy which includes children aged 5 and above is estimated to reduce the peak in daily case numbers by approximately 2000 per 1 million population, for coverage levels of 70% and 80%. ",Yes,"These correspond to the Stage 3 measures adopted by the State
of Victoria, Australia, in 2020 and 2021, estimated as 20% workplace non-attendance and 60% community contact reduction [8], altered to include schools remaining open.

Protection against poor health outcomes in those vaccinated and having breakthrough infections was implicitly included by using recent UK Delta variant data [15] to give age-specific case/hospitalisation and case/mortality ratios, as in Additional file 1: Table S1

We thus assume all immunity effects are attained as the result of vaccination, rather than immunity derived from infection. Australia adopted an age-specific vaccination strategy in March 2021 due to limited supplies of mRNA vaccines, with those aged 60 year and over vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured locally,
with all younger age groups vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. Our study assumed a modified vaccination strategy by using the Pfizer mRNA vaccine to boost the immune response of those previously vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, necessary due to its lower efficacy against the Delta variant [17, 22–24].",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions,"We assumed immunity was derived from vaccination with the BNT162b2 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine.

We modelled the BNT162b2 Pfizer vaccine with assumed protection against Delta infection of 88%. This percentage of individuals is assumed to remain immune for a period of at least 6 months, without immunity waning

In the absence of further evidence, we assumed protection against infection to be the same as protection against disease

. Thus, a Delta variant outbreak was assumed to occur after all vaccinations had been completed and was modelled by the short-term seeding of infectious individuals into randomly selected households

The study assumed an Australian setting with effectively no immunity resulting from infection due to early international border closures and the adoption of a SARS-CoV-2 elimination policy. We thus assume all immunity effects are attained as the result of vaccination, rather than immunity derived from infection

Our study assumed a modified vaccination strategy by using the Pfizer mRNA vaccine to boost the immune response of those previously vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, necessary due to its lower efficacy against the Delta variant [17, 22–24]. This approach allowed us to simplify the modelled scenarios by assuming all vaccinated individuals had either a second or third dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and thus, the same protective effect following their most recent vaccination.

We assumed that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine gave protection against Delta infection of 88%.

In the absence of data relevant to the Delta variant, we have made the following assumptions. Child and adolescent susceptibility is taken to be the same as adults, based on the high levels of cases in these age groups observed in the UK [15]. Child transmissibility is assumed to be 50% that of adults due to the reduced level of symptoms observed in this age group [25]. The probability of a symptomatic case isolating is hard to estimate, varying greatly according to severity of symptoms, and testing and home isolation compliance. A value of 33% was chosen to reflect a high proportion of cases with mild symptoms and a moderate/low level of testing and isolation compliance.

",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",Yes,"Due to slight nuances across facilities that can greatly affect transmission patterns, we created an interactive online dashboard that accepts facility-specific parameters and forecasts infection rates and worker days missed under a set of transmission characteristics and testing protocols (dashboard is accessible here: https://ltcf-covid.shinyapps.io/ltcf_covid_ dashboard/)(Dilliott, 2021). This dashboard allowed facility administrators to evaluate the relative impact of various strategies moving forward. In what follows, we explore the trade-off between a high cadence testing regime at a moderately vaccinated facility to a no testing regime at a highly vaccinated facility to demonstrate how the ABM and dashboard could be utilized by practioners.

While our model and analysis are tailored to LTCFs in the United States, our model could be adapted to other countries in which vulnerable populations live in facilities with staff that provide care. Our ABM model of LTFCs could also be coupled with forecasting models that predict community prevalence (Dawoud, 2020) via the probability that staff become infected while off duty.

Our work here acts as an example of how a rich infectious disease model can be programed and integrated into a user-friendly dashboard to serve public health administrators. Importantly, this tool could also be adapted relatively easily to model the particulars of any existing or future respiratory pathogen.",Yes,United States,Considered and imposed,"Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the total number of infections across three vaccination scenarios (37.5%, 80%, and 90%) and three testing scenarios (None, qRT-PCR, and Rapid) for 500 simulations.

Each infected staff member has a chance of showing symptoms, self-isolating, and staying home from work.

If vaccine uptake among staff and residents is limited or moderate, a facility director may consider regular facility-wide testing of unvaccinated individuals to combat the possibility and extent of an outbreak. Upon a positive test result, we use a 14-day quarantine for staff.

If testing is scheduled for the given day, all non-quarantined staff and residents are tested. If the test result delay is zero, such as for a rapid test, then those that test positive, whether a staff member or resident, are immediately placed in quarantine where they have no contact with others.

Symptomatic infected individuals independently randomly decide whether to self-quarantine each day according to a fixed probability.

Assume residents and staff are vaccinated at rates mirroring the national averages, 78%, and 38%, respectively at this time, and the 7-day case rate average for the community is approximately 84 people per 100,000/week.",,,,,,,,,,,No,,Yes,ODD,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
Assume residents and staff are vaccinated at rates mirroring the national averages, 78%, and 38%, respectively at this time, and the 7-day case rate average for the community is approximately 84 people per 100,000/week.

While interactions are assumed to be random each day, a contact matrix dictates the relative number of contacts between different subgroups. For example, day staff and night staff are assumed to have limited contact that occurs just during shift changes.

We assume a vaccine efficacy of 95% in an “all-or-nothing” framework, such that 5% of those vaccinated remain susceptible to infection (Bubar et al., 2021).

In this study, we assume an qRT-PCR test with 95% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity, and a rapid antigen test with 64.2% sensitivity on symptomatic positive individuals, 35.8% sensitivity on asymptomatic individuals and 99.5% specificity.

We assume that symptomatic staff will report their illness and self-isolate with some probability.

Staff are also susceptible to becoming exposed from the community based on the community prevalence, where it is assumed they contact 5 community individuals per day.

Although positive residents would continue to contact the staff at the LTCF, it is assumed that the PPE protocols for staff are such that there is no probability of transmission.

A fixed fraction of staff and residents are specified to be fully vaccinated at the start of the simulation and a fixed fraction of staff and residents are assumed to be initially infected.

The probability a random individual in the community is infectious is estimated to be 14/100,000 times the 14-day case rate, which roughly assumes an individual is infectious for a full 14-day interval.

Each staff member is assumed to come into contact with five individuals each day so this probability they are infected from the community is 1 e (1e14/100,000*(14-daycase rate))^5.

In a typical compartmental epidemiological model (e.g., SEIR), the generation interval is the mean duration in the exposed class (latent period) plus the mean duration in the infectious class (infectious period), which we assume are 5 and 8 days, respectively. These assumptions imply a generation interval of 13 days which is longer than the time between generations observed during the COVID-19 pandemic (Tang et al., 2021).

Limitations
The results of the LTCF-ABM should be considered along with model limitations. We strived to use realistic parameters when estimates were available from the literature. However, some parameters were not well studied at this time. We assumed a contact structure between staff and residents that is static over the simulation. This may not be true if staff limit their contact with each other and residents in the event of an outbreak. Researchers have also documented increased risk to facilities whose staff work at other facilities (Chen et al., 2021). This additional risk was not explicitly modeled here but could be captured by assuming a higher community prevalence quantifying the risk of outside infection to staff. The testing protocol is determined at the beginning of the simulation and does not change. Facilities that detect a positive case may engage in investigation and more rigorous testing procedures to mitigate the further spread of the virus. However, one important result from our analysis is that when community transmission is present, there is a continual risk that a staff member reintroduces the virus.",Yes,"https://ltcf-covid.shinyapps.io/ltcf_covid_ dashboard/

Together with other studies employing similar design, it can serve not only to expand our knowledge on covid19 transmission but it can be used by public health authorities and policy makers for informed decisions on safe school operations during the covid-19 pandemic.

Additionally, the model may be extended by calibrating its parameters to different variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or even to different viruses altogether provided that the relevant transmission pathways are interpersonal contact networks such as with other respiratory diseases. This makes our study relevant even in a post-pandemic world as it can be relatively quickly adopted to epidemic outbreaks within school settings in the future much like similar studies (see also24,25).",Yes, Czechia (Czech Republic),Considered and imposed,"Rotation scenarios comprise weekly rotations of primary school pupils (secondary school is closed), secondary school rotations (primary school without restrictions), weekly rotation of all classes, and weekly rotation of halves of classes.

Data from this survey described a multilevel multiplex network with two types of nodes: pupils and teachers. Six types of contacts among the pupils relevant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission were studied in the survey: sitting next to each other at a desk; contacts during breaks; contacts during lunch; contacts in after-school care; contacts in school-based voluntary activities; and contacts outside the school. Additional three types of relevant contacts among teachers were examined in the survey: contacts in a shared office; contacts within the school but outside an office; and contacts outside the school.

Then an artificial scenario assumes the same attendance with fully immune, noninfectious teachers.

As the modelled rotations do not assume any changes to the composition of the class, they bring about only a limited disturbance to a normal school operation.

As any other model or simulation, our model is built on certain assumptions. One such assumption relates to the behavior of a person tested with a negative test result. We assume that a false negative test result does not alter behavior of the tested person in a significant way compared to behavior with no test at all.

In a similar vein, we assume that individuals in our simulations are entirely compliant with the anti-epidemic measures imposed upon them (such as isolation following a positive test). This assumption may not necessarily hold in all situations, for example after a prolonged lockdown and restrictions.

In both regimes we assume that positive pupils won’t infect any other pupil after taking the test and that they don’t continue to attend school after positive test. We don’t assume any other quarantine or isolation measures regarding the rest of the class.

Specifically, consider the following event sequence: (i) The pool of all contacts (ct−1 in number) who came in contact with COVID-19 positive individuals on day t − 1are tested and then a portion of the institution population is tested under the institution’s bulk testing policy, (ii) members of the institution, as a result of their daily affairs, come in contact with other individuals within and outside the institution that results in new infection transmission, (iii) test results arrive, all COVID-19 positive individuals are isolated, and a list of contacts of all COVID-19 positive individuals is created to be tested the following day, and (iv) some infected individuals recover.

Specifically, we study how rapid bulk testing, contact tracing and preventative measures such as mask wearing, sanitization, and enforcement of social distancing can allow institutions to manage the epidemic spread.",Yes,"We utilize the daily number of tests and infections from the SHIELD testing program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Champaign County, IL. In addition, we use less granular data of weekly new infections and testing conducted at 85 large universities other than UIUC across 78 counties in the US (see list in “Appendix 2”).",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Let, Tt denote the testing capacity on day t that is assumed to exceed ct−1 , the number of contact traced individuals.

Following the protocols of the UIUC SHIELD program, we assume that bulk testing is conducted at a predetermined regular frequency among the mobile part of the population that comprises susceptible, undetected infectious and recovered individuals. Detected positive individuals are assumed to be isolated.

We assume that positive test results from bulk tests on day t within the tested population occurs at the same frequency as the ratio of undetected positive individuals to the total susceptible population among the mobile part of the population.

Multiplying the above probabilities and summing over k yields the probability of a new infection to be β0 t mtI ut /nt, when β0 is assumed small (β0 ≈ 1−8% as estimated from data from US universities in parameter estimation from data).

The approximation is derived in the “Derivation of the probability of infection of an individual among the contact list, φ(β0 t , mtI , pt )” section of “Appendix 1” under the assumption that mtI ≪ -pt−1 ≪ nt−1 .

The average recovery rate γ is assumed to be the inverse of the average time to recover.

First, we assume that the segment pt that has tested positive and is isolated from the rest of the population is relatively small compared to the total population of an institution, i.e., nt ≈ n and st ≈ n − ut − rt .

Second, we assume that the positivity rate among the daily bulk tests is a good approximation of the infection incidence within the whole population within the institution, i.e., pt /Tt ≈ ut /n .

To find θt, define t := (θt , ...θt ) that assumes the same value of the parameter for each time over the D days and minimizes the weighted squared error

We also relax several simplifying assumptions made to derive the analytical model in these agent-based simulations. Different testing policies are then evaluated over multiple sample paths with less restrictive assumptions, making the resulting policy evaluations more immune to said assumptions and the randomness of the infection process.

In our simulations, we assumed the efficiency of contact testing to be η = 0.9 and the efficiency of isolation to be ψ = 0.95 . To make our simulations more realistic we assumed that the tests have a sensitivity of 0.92.

Given that the average delay between conducting a test and revealing the test result at UIUC is generally below 12 h, we assume that test results are available immediately in our simulations.

The agent-based simulation results presented so far assume that the institution has a population with homogeneous mobilities that we estimate from data.

We assume that students have an internal contact rate of mI = 5.5 , compared to that ofmI = 3 for faculty/staff.

While we have so far assumed that isolation is 100%, in reality isolation efficiency tends to vary significantly.

Perfectly tracing all contacts of a positive individual is challenging.

In our analysis, we do not include the effect of climate due to lack of data and due to the fact that all universities that we analyze are located in the United States, and therefore, the climate variation is not too high.

We assume that each edge is active once per day, so that the node degree corresponds to the number of contacts per day.

Assume that an individual did infect n persons.

We assume that a fraction papp of the population uses the DCT system and that we can trace all contacts between users of this system with time delay Tdelay.

We assume that from the group of symptomatic carriers, a fraction fm sees a doctor to get tested with a reliable laboratory test and is then reported.

We assume that all reported symptomatic patients are immediately quarantined, regardless of any other interventions.

We assume the tests have ptrue positive =0.0while the carrier is in the latent period, that is up to approximately 2.5 days before symptom onset.

We further assume that the laboratory test then has a true positive rate of 100% until the carrier has recovered.

This is done with a testing protocol assumed to have a negligible number of false positives.

The basic assumption is that the state of an individual is a function of his/her age of infection, that is the time that has passed since he or she became infected.

Assuming that α is about 60% in European populations and that not everyone who has symptoms sees a doctor or is tested, the region between α · fm =0.4to0.6islikelyrelevant for Europe.

The results presented so far assumed a homogeneous population of size 1 × 105 and a distribution of the number of contacts with infection potential per day from Eq. (3).

Our simulations assume that the same interventions are applied throughout the epidemic, so the outcomes over 1 year are guidelines rather than realistic predictions for any real country.

We assume that traced contacts that are still in the exposed phase Ee t are immediately isolated and can no longer infect others.

In order to understand κ(a), we consider two simplified scenarios first: (a) we assume that we can only trace contacts from infectee to infector (backward tracing), and (b) we assume that we can only trace contact from infector to infectee (forward tracing).

Since we assume homogeneous mixing, we obtain the overall reproduction number as Reff

We furthermore assume that the infectious period is a fixed (deterministic) time span Tcon. This assumption about the latent period is an input for the age-dependent infection rate as well as for the recovery rate.

The sensitivity of all outcomes to the reported ranges of values of the epidemiological parameters is studied in detail.

For the lower app coverages, the results are barely sensitive to ηDCT because DCT is not very effective to begin with.

When 75% of symptomatic cases are reported, Re has large fluctuations between simulation runs, and outcomes are very sensitive to the fraction of symptomatic cases.

Our basic calibration approach is to determine the values of the majority of the parameters based on direct empirical evidence from different data sources and calibrate the remaining parameters, for which no such direct evidence is available, in a way that the model output well matches empirical time series of key variables related to the pandemic and economic indicators in Germany between the outbreak of the pandemic and the end of the third quarter of 2020.

Epidemiological parameters, like fatality rates, intensive care utilization13, and the detection rate, are taken from German data (mainly from the Robert Koch Institut)

Furthermore, we assume that the current crisis has no effect on the capital stock and hence do not explicitly incorporate a capital goods sector into our model.

As explained below, we take a reduced form approach for describing the capacity of the healthcare system, by assuming a maximum number of available intensive care unit beds for COVID-19 infected and calibrating this number from empirical data

Based on empirical observations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assume that at day tmut a new and more contagious virus mutation emerges

It is assumed that in the absence of virus containment measures no employees work from home or are on short time work.

It should also be noted that we assume that agents do not change their behavior and their contact patterns after infection. This simplifying assumption is based on the observations that a large fraction of infected individuals do not show symptoms12 and that at least in the initial months of the pandemic no large-scale testing facilities were available

More precisely, we assume that the weekly shopping probability during lockdown is reduced to ps,l = (1, 1, 1) − αl (%p s,l M , %p s,l S , 0

We assume that economic support measures accompany the virus containment policies in order to counteract the economic disruptions and to keep the number of insolvencies low: (i) Under the short-time work scheme firms put a fraction qst of employees on short time work. Employees on short time receive a fraction ϕ < 1 of their regular wage paid by a transfer from the public account. (ii) Under the bailout policy, the government bails out any firm with negative liquidity in a given period, balancing the firm’s account with a transfer from the public account, thereby avoiding bankruptcy. In our policy analysis below, we assume that both measures are activated at the time of the first lockdown, and then maintained till the containment policy is lifted.

3 We assume that at most 50% of beds available in intensive care units can be used to treat COVID-19 patients

A crucial assumption in this respect is that in our setting productivity of workers is not reduced when they work from home

Similar to the default policy scenario (Fig. 3), we assume that 2 weeks after the initial occurrence of the virus at t = 0, individual preventive measures, social distancing, working from home, and lockdown measures are activated

During the opening-up phase, we assume that the working from home measure remains active. After approximately 5 months, we introduce a virus mutation with an infection probability increased by 50%. Moreover, all runs are based on the assumption that 18 months after the first occurrence of the virus, a vaccine has been developed and a sufficient percentage of the population has been vaccinated to prevent any further transmissions of the virus

In addition, we assume that a lockdown is lifted once the incidence of newly infected falls below βo = 5 for all policy scenarios. In Appendix B, we show that policies using larger values of βo are dominated by those considered here.

In our main analysis, we assumed that a vaccine is administered instantaneously to the entire population and works with 100% effectiveness.

We assume that vaccine effectiveness declines at a constant rate of 0.34%-points per day, which implies that the effectiveness after 6 months is 23% in line with empirical data (Nordström et al. 2022).

We assume that the initial stocks of infected, recovered and deceased individuals are set equal to zero.

We assume that after tvac days from the beginning of the pandemic, a vaccine becomes available on the market and agents start to get vaccinated. For most of our analysis, we assume that all susceptible households are assumed to receive vaccination immediately and the epidemic ends as soon as the remaining infected households recover or die

The assumed number of intensive care beds is 30 per 100.000 households, which is based on German data (Rhodes et al. 2012). Finally, we assume that a vaccine will be available 18 months after the initial spread of the virus. The pandemic related data for our calibration is summarized in Table 3.

We rely on British data to calibrate the mutation (Chand et al. 2020) and assume the transmission probability increases by 50% for a household infected with the mutated virus. Hence, in case one of the newly infected agents meets a susceptible household, the infection probability is given by pmut inf = 1.5 pinf . A household inherits the type from the infecting agent. Finally, we assume that data such as latency period or fatality rate as given in Table 3 is the same for a household infected by the mutation

Furthermore, we assume that working from home does not decrease the firm’s productivity level Ai . Based on survey data (Lehrer et al. 2020), we assume that, when social distancing is active, the upper bounds of social contacts are reduced to n p yy = 2, n p oo = 1, n p yo = 1, and n p oy = 1.",Yes,https:// github.com/ETACE/ace_covid19,No,,One discipline,Social Sciences,"Applied mathematics, Economics","Bielefeld Graduate School of Economics and Management (BiGSEM), Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany

The parameter αl governs the intensity of the lockdown and %p s,l M , %p s,l S are calibrated such that the intensity of the lockdown measures taken in Germany in March 2020 corresponds to αl = 1.

4 Model calibration

Our basic calibration approach is to determine the values of the majority of the parameters based on direct empirical evidence from different data sources and calibrate the remaining parameters, for which no such direct evidence is available, in a way that the model output well matches empirical time series of key variables related to the pandemic and economic indicators in Germany between the outbreak of the pandemic and the end of the third quarter of 2020. Here, we provide a summary of the key aspects of this approach, and details of the calibration of the model are provided in Appendix A.4.

Additional economic parameters, like the firms’ sector-specific inventory buffers or mark-up ranges are calibrated to generate a stationary GDP per capita and unemployment rate that reasonably match the German economy before the pan demic. In particular, for the pre-pandemic period, the model generates an annual GDP per capita of 43.013e and an unemployment rate of 3.98% (average over 50 runs) compared to an annual GDP per capita (Eurostat 2020a) of 41.350e and an average unemployment rate (Eurostat 2020b) of 3.2% in 2019.

The calibration of the parameters describing the containment measures, the sector-specific effects on consumption and on the reduction in contacts is based on German data on policy interventions, societal activities, and economic losses during and after the first lockdown in March 2020 (see Appendix A.4 for all parameter choices and sources). The individual contact infection probability pinf is calibrated to match an R0 value of 2.5 (without any containment policy), in accordance with empirical evidence (Read et al. 2020). The effectiveness of individual prevention measures ξ , for which no direct empirical observations are available, is calibrated by targeting key properties of infection dynamics in Germany over a time span of 6 months

Although only three free parameters (ξl , ξ o, qst) were calibrated to target these empirical time series, the generated data is consistent with its empirical counterpart, both with respect to levels and dynamic patterns.

To see the effect of individual prevention measures in our model, we analyze a setup in which only ξ increases to the calibrated benchmark value of ξl = 0.625 2 weeks after the appearance of the virus.

Starting from point A, corresponding to the calibrated German policy scenario (1, 0, 50), we systematically vary the key parameters (αl , αo, βl ).

We show that the calibrated model replicates the economic and epidemic dynamics in Germany in the first 6 months after the COVID-19 outbreak well and employ the model to compare the effects of different alternative policy approaches.

Whereas these results have been obtained in calibration of the model based on German data and the COVID-19 pandemic, the mechanisms underlying our findings clearly apply more generally such that these policy insights should carry over to other economies with a similar structure as well as to other pandemics driven by similar kinds of virus transmission.

To verify the statistical significance of differences between points A, B, C, and D in Fig. 6 and Table 1 in mortality and average GDP loss, we use the Mann–Whitney U test, a nonparametric test for unpaired samples.

The empirical validity of the model is established using data on economic and pandemic dynamics in Germany in the first 6 months after the COVID-19 outbreak",Yes,"We also demonstrate that the policies differ substantially with respect to the ex ante uncertainty about the induced economic loss. In particular, the policies which are at the efficiency frontier also tend to give rise to substantially lower variation. Understanding the implications of different policy choices for the variance of policy results seems particularly important in an area like virus containment, where the effectiveness of chosen measures also depends on the policies’ acceptance by the general public

Since the value of the infection probability of the virus on the one hand is crucial for the epidemic dynamics and on the other hand entails a considerable uncertainty around its exact value, we conduct a robustness check of our results concerning this parameter

In addition to the detailed description of the model, the Appendix contains some results with respect to additional policy variations, statistical test results underlying our findings, and lists of model variables and of parameter values

In the absence of any policy measures, a susceptible household is infected with the homogeneous infection probability pinf at each contact with an infectious agent. Due to policy measures, this probability is reduced to (1 − ξ )pinf , where the value of ξ depends on the type of measures implemented (see below).

Our basic calibration approach is to determine the values of the majority of the parameters based on direct empirical evidence from different data sources and calibrate the remaining parameters, for which no such direct evidence is available, in a way that the model output well matches empirical time series of key variables related to the pandemic and economic indicators in Germany between the outbreak of the pandemic and the end of the third quarter of 2020.

Fig. 4 Dynamics. Solid lines show averages over 50 Monte Carlo runs, dotted lines plus-minus one standard deviation bands across Monte Carlo runs.

Figure 5 summarizes the timeline underlying our policy analysis. For each considered policy scenario, we carry out 50 simulation runs of the model in order to capture the variance of the emerging dynamics. The main results from our analysis are summarized in Fig. 6, which shows the average GDP loss and total mortality after 24 months (mean over the 50 runs) under a systematic variation of the policy parameters

Table 1 contains mean values and standard deviations for key indicators, such as the duration of the lockdown or the public deficit, across the batch runs for each of the four key policies. In Tables 10 and 11 in Appendix D we provide information on the statistical significance of the differences in induced GDP loss and mortality between the key policies based on Mann–Whitney U tests.

Effects of policies with a ‘weak lockdown’ (C, D) can be predicted with higher certainty than for policies inducing switches between strong lockdown and full opening (A, B) in terms of GDP loss. In turn, for these policies (C,D) the overall mortality is harder to predict in comparison with policies A and B.

Considering the standard deviation for the different indicators across batch runs, Table 1 shows that the GDP loss induced by policies with weak lockdowns (C,D) varies much less across runs than the GDP loss under policies A and B. Put differently, the economic implications of policies C and D are much better predictable compared to alternative approaches. The downside for this difference is that under policies C and D the variance of the dynamics of infected is substantially larger compared to policies A and B. In particular, for policy A the timing for the second wave is predictable while for policy B, the second wave is prevented by many small lockdowns without varying strongly across runs. In contrast, under policies C and D second large waves (slowly) develop for some of the runs and hence the infection dynamics are harder to predict. Overall, a trade-off in uncertainty emerges with a higher prediction accuracy in GDP loss (C,D) or in mortality (A,B).

5.3 Effects of a variation of the virus infectiousness

Whereas in the previous section we examined the relationship between different lock down policy designs and the (ex ante) uncertainty of the policy effects with respect to our two key indicators, in this section we focus on the question of how robust our insights about policy effects are with respect to a variation in the infectiousness of the virus and with respect to the absence of the virus mutation. Examining such robustness seems important since in particular at the beginning of the pandemic data about the basic infection probability pinf and the effectiveness of individual protection mea sures (ξ ) is hardly available. Hence, one should account for substantial uncertainty about these parameters. Furthermore, the occurrence of (more infectious) mutations can hardly be predicted both with respect to the timing of such an occurrence and the properties of the mutations. Although we do not carry out an extensive exploration of the effects of different pandemic scenarios, we develop some intuition on how strongly the effects of our main policies change under such variations by comparing two alternative scenarios with our default scenario considered so far. First, we consider a counterfactual scenario in which no mutations occur after the initial outbreak of the pandemic, such that throughout the entire considered time horizon of 18 months only the original version of the virus with the calibrated infection probability pinf is active. Compared to our default scenario where a more infectious mutation occurs after sev eral months, this captures a situation with a weaker diffusion of the virus. We refer to it as the no mutation scenario. Second, we study a scenario where the value of pinf is increased by 25% compared to our standard calibration and again no mutation occurs. Compared to our default scenario, this corresponds to a situation where initially the infectiousness of the virus is larger, but in the long run it is lower. (The infectiousness of the mutation in our default scenario is 50% above pinf .) We refer to this as the higher pinf scenario

Fig. 9 Box plots for the scenarios mutation (default, blue), no mutation (red) and higher pinf (green) over 50 batch runs. a, c GDP loss [%] measured as loss averaged over simulation time span of 728 periods (24 months) as a percentage of baseline and b, d mortality [%] expressed as a percentage of population (color figure online)

Policies characterized by switches between strict lockdowns and full openings based on large incidence thresholds are strictly dominated by frontier policies and also give rise to substantially larger ex ante uncertainty about the actual economic loss to be induced by the policy. We also show that most of these insights are robust with respect to variations of the pandemic scenarios.

Definition 1 (kNN). Let the kNN radius of x→X↓Rd be k(x):↑inf{ : |B(x, )↗X|↘k}, where B(x, )de notes the open metric ball of radius >0, centered at x. Let Nk(x)denote the k-neighborhood of x, such that Nk(x):↑B(x, k(x))↗X.

At each time step, if only one individual will be sampled, based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty (Auer et al. 2002), the upper confidence bound (UCB) policies define the largest plausible estimate of each individual node as f t(i):↑ˆ f t(i)+ ·(Nt(i)) 1=(2+d) logNt(i)log 1 !"" s : (2) To ensure that the upper confidence bound decreases with respect to the size Nt(i)of the neighborhood, we modified the UCB for any N (2e) (2 +d)log 1+ t 1 , (i) ↔ ≃e 2 ⇐ +1 to be based on Lemma EC.1 in the e-companion. Then the algorithm chooses the arm that maximizes the above quantity.

The confidence level should be small enough to ensure optimism with high probability, but not so small that the larger upper confidence bounds will result in excessive exploration of suboptimal arms.

To test whether the outer-level exploration (outside of the observed con tact network) is needed, we remove the outer-level TS, and only use kNN-UCB to select individuals from the observed network (kNN-UCB). To test the proposed quantification of uncertainty, we remove the optimistic UCB term and only choose nodes based on kNN prediction as the inner-level selection policy (kNN-TS)

b1,age is the estimated baseline daily probability of infection as a function of the age of the susceptible individual (after a contact with an infectious individual).

The stays in states E, Ip, A, Ips, Ims, and Iss were generated from Weibull distributions. When more than one destination state was possible, the transition was selected at random using the corresponding probability (i.e., pA, pIps, pIms or pIss). The proportions of the various symptomatic forms were considered dependent on age (Table 2).

The reduction in virus transmission in the susceptible individuals after the first injection (or first infection) was fixed at b51 = 0.80 without linear decrease before the second injection (3 weeks later) or the occurrence of COVID-19. The reduction in susceptible individuals after the second injection (or infection following the first dose of vaccine) was fixed at b51 = 0.80, and its linear decrease six months later (b52 (tI)) set so as to obtain a value of 0.58 (optimistic immunity decline) or 0.44 (pessimistic immunity decline). A similar approach was proposed by Bosetti et al. [22]. The reduction in virus transmission due to the booster dose of vaccine in never-infected individuals (third injection) or in previously infected then susceptible again individuals (second injection) was fixed at b51 = 0.95 without decrease.

It combined, after a second injection of vaccine in previously uninfected individuals (or after a single injection in previously infected individuals), an initial 95% reduction in the risk of hospitalization with a linear decrease of this reduction so as to obtain a value of 0.88 or 0.78 six months later with optimistic and pessimistic immunity decrease, respectively. After a booster dose of vaccine in previously uninfected individuals (third injection) or in previously infected individuals (second injection), a 95% reduction in the risk of hospitalization was set without change over time

To account for the lack of information considering θ, the calibration of the infection probability has been performed for different values of θ ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 to reproduce the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases in Austria [14]. This calibration process has been split into two parts: calibrating the infection probability α1 and α2 before and after the peak of the epidemic wave. In the first part, the infection probability α1 is calibrated using a bisection algorithm with a Monte-Carlo Simulation in the loop to reproduce the officially reported number of confirmed cases at the peak of the epidemic wave. In the second part, α2 is adjusted using the same bisection algorithm to reproduce the decrease of the officially reported number of positive COVID-19 cases in Austria until June 10th 2020.

Screening programs using antibody tests are less sensitive but still depend on timing during the epidemic. The different severities between detected and undetected cases lead to different disease lengths. Therefore, the confirmed cases are underrepresented within the total cases as long as the disease wave is still on the upswing (see Fig. 5). Consequently, results of antibody screenings would underestimate the detection rate, if performed too early before the completion of the wave. Similarly, considering the indication of waning antibody, screenings performed too long after an epidemic wave could underestimate the total number of COVID-19 infections, and therefore, overestimate the detection rate.

Nevertheless, taking the dynamic of the epidemic wave into consideration, the first PCR study in Austria performed by SORA in April (sample size n = 1544) [4] could be used to determine feasible values for the detection probability. The study estimates a prevalence of 28, 500 infected persons in Austria for April 4th. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, this leads to ϑ =0.13. Note that number is considerably lower than the prevalent ratio between detected and undetected 8358/28,500 ≈ 0.29 on this day [14]. Consequently, a large error is made when estimating the detection rate based on this naïve formula.

Furthermore, as for all current simulation models for COVID-19, the parameters used in our model are associated with uncertainty. In particular, the recovery time for undetected cases – that is, the time until these mostly asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals are no longer infectious – is highly uncertain. This is certainly an influential parameter in the model but real data and evidence for its values are diverse and hard to find

Since this number of total ICU-beds and human resources available for COVID-19 patients in Austria is not fixed but can be slightly adapted to the current need, our model does not consider a threshold for the available medical resources and a subsequential change in the CFR as soon as the maximal capacities are exceeded. Therefore, an estimation of the fatal cases is associated with great uncertainty, and even more importantly, provides no added value to the model results of the current research question of our study."

We set vaccination schedules using anticipated age-specific vaccination volumes from the NHS vaccination programme.

To set future NPI contacts we use the values from the latest calibrated timestep as a baseline and adjust these based on known future changes to networks (e. g. school holidays) or policy (e.g. the UK government roadmap; Gov.uk, 2021c).

To do this we fix assumptions on the contact parameters that will be used in the simulation and run a grid search to calibrate the mean infectious period (a global parameter that is not geography specific) and then the infectious rate (a per-geography parameter that controls the mean number of individuals infected by each infectious individual with moderate to severe symptoms).

Our calibration method calibrates the transmission risk in occupation and random networks only based on the assumption that NPIs had little effect on transmission risk between household contacts.

Finally, we present a compilation of all the ‘central assumptions’ scenarios for hospital admissions run from October 2020 to February 2022 (the time period when the model was being used for operational planning purposes; Fig. 6).

c) as the result of an incorrect assumption in inputs (e.g. the emergence of the Omicron varant in December 2021)

By systematically varying our assumptions of NPI contact levels through December we were able to explore scenarios where contacts returned to a higher level than they had been prior to the lockdown (e.g. if people ‘made up for lost time’ by increasing the number of contacts they made through the month of December 2020). 

Simulated scenarios were based on assumptions about future vaccine roll out informed by the vaccination team and government assumptions used in SPI-M-O modelling (Gov.uk, 2021b).

For example, assuming that Delta is twice as transmissible as Alpha would produce a completely different simulated future epidemic wave compared to if Delta was three times more transmissible. Similarly different assumptions of the vaccine efficacy of the emerging new variant will profoundly affect medium-term and long-term epidemic trajectories.

Limitation, challenge, caveat
We discuss the data resources that enabled this work and the data challenges that were faced.

In carrying out this work we encountered challenges in parameterising and running the model.

A key challenge with using simulated scenarios for planning lies in providing sensible parameter inputs for future time periods.

The full calibration process is computationally intensive (e.g. the initial searches for mean infectious period and infectious rate with the default of 10 random seeds requires 4200 individual simulations per epoch and at least 16,800 runs overall), and takes multiple days, even running in parallel on the high-performance Azure Batch system.

We recognise that our operational prioritisation of speed may at times have been achieved at the expense of less robust calibration and that there are likely ways to reduce the computational burden.

For our operational use cases an essential part of the calibration process was the review of the parameters returned and the careful presentation of results to planners and decision makers alongside relevant caveats and explanation.

A key limitation of our work is that Open-ABM-Covid19 is a detailed model that offers control of a range of epidemiological, social network and interventional parameters, which need to be carefully set.",No,,Yes,OpenABM-Covid19,One discipline,Social Sciences,Economics,"Economics and Strategic Analysis, NHS England, London, UK

Sensitivities to different vaccine effectiveness estimates were tested and the effectiveness of the vaccine against admission in the central scenario was updated in line with emerging evidence.

In addition to datasets controlled by the NHS, we made use of a number of public and other datasets to parameterise and cross-validate our modelling efforts.

To check how well the calibration represents the epidemiology of the epidemic we cross-validate the calibrated model output against publicly available incidence data from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (Office for National Statistics, 2021a, 2021b) and official case data. Importantly, the model is calibrated to hospital admissions and subsequent clinical events, but undergoes no calibration to infection, positivity or case data.

We developed a method for calibrating the model to three daily data streams (hospital admissions, intensive care occupancy, and deaths), and demonstrate that on cross-validation the model fits acceptably to unseen data streams including official estimates of COVID-19 incidence. Once calibrated, we use the model to simulate future scenarios of the spread of COVID-19 in England and show that the simulations provide useful projections of future COVID-19 clinical demand.

Additionally we describe our data and calibration software framework, which automates the analyses. We show that our method produces accurate calibrations to censored health data, allowing flexible simulation of hospital admissions and occupancy scenarios for healthcare planning and for investigation of uncertainties.

By default the model population is one million inhabitants with demographic structure based upon UK-wide census data, and is parameterised to UK demographics (including population size, age profile and household structure) and calibrated to the early UK epidemic; however, it is easily re-parameterised for other populations.

2.3. Calibration method section
Through the COVID-19 pandemic we have used abmcal to regularly calibrate OpenABM-Covid19 to up-to-date NHS SitRep data in England.

We developed a calibration method based on hyperparameter grid search of a defined parameter space to set the epidemiological parameters (Fig. 2).

We first calibrate two epidemiological parameters to match observed hospital admissions, critical care occupancy and deaths observed over the first peak of the COVID-19epidemic in England (up to 1 June 2020). To do this we fix assumptions on the contact parameters that will be used in the simulation and run a grid search to calibrate the mean infectious period (a global parameter that is not geography specific) and then the infectious rate (a per-geography parameter that controls the mean number of individuals infected by each infectious individual with moderate to severe symptoms).

Once the best-fit mean infectious period and infectious rate parameters are identified we hold these constant and run a further grid search over the entire epidemic curve to calibrate the per-geography relative transmission strengths for occupation and random networks to fit the observed hospital admission SitReps (given age-stratified individual contact levels on different networks, interventions such as vaccinations and school closures, and the underlying differences in transmission between networks).

Our calibration method calibrates the transmission risk in occupation and random networks only based on the assumption that NPIs had little effect on transmission risk between household contacts. We review the outputs after each epoch to verify that the calibration process had avoided any unnatural local minima and the parameter value identified could be considered appropriate for the purposes of further calibration and simulation.

As a result, once the base calibration is established, we use a simplified method where we re-search the latest model time periods (typically 2–4 week periods defined by policy or other changes to the context of the epidemic) to find transmission strengths that match the most-recent SitRep and vaccination data; these updates run overnight and enable timely updates to calibration to be produced.

These parameters are fixed up to the end date of calibration, but are permitted to change on specified future dates.

From December 2020 we modified our calibration method to take into account the actual per-age-group vaccine uptakes obtained from the vaccine data mart (Fig. 8A). Regional differences in vaccine uptake were taken into account in the calibration, with the most significant difference being the uptake in London versus the other six NHS regions (Fig. 8B).",Yes,"To generate each scenario we run 1000 simulations from the start of the pandemic to a defined time in the future using the same population of agents used in the calibration run, which represents the entire population of England, across different random seeds using the given parameter set. abmcal outputs the median model run as well as 10thand 90th centiles.

Model uncertainty is assessed by running multiple simulations using different random seeds and aggregating the results to produce central estimates (proxied by the median of the simulations) as well as estimates of stochastic variation (proxied by the range within the 10th and 90th percentiles).

The full calibration process is computationally intensive (e.g. the initial searches for mean infectious period and infectious rate with the default of 10 random seeds requires 4200 individual simulations per epoch and at least 16,800 runs overall), and takes multiple days, even running in parallel on the high-performance Azure Batch system.

We typically describe and simulate a set of related scenarios that includes our main scenario, alternative hypotheses, sensitivity tests and counterfactuals.

Additionally, we observed a trend where the uncertainty range tended to decrease as the number of subjects increased. For instance, our findings indicate that the uncertainty range for 100 subjects was comparable in magnitude to the estimates obtained from population data.

and data sources.

The study considers two types of vaccines, one with an efficacy of 65.8% (representing Johnson & Johnson) and the other with 95% efficacy (representing the mRNA-platform vaccines from
Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) in preventing COVID infection [21–23].

Second, for a global analysis, it is beyond the scope of the study to evaluate the data quality from every country and make adjustments accordingly. As a result, the findings may suffer from biases if pandemic data are underreported or inaccurate. The same goes for travel data. 

Third, the current model setting may not sufficiently account for multiple waves, particularly when the scale (e.g., peak and duration) substantially varies by wave. In these cases, our model is more affected by the most recent or current wave than previous waves.

The subsequent 40 days are used for out-of-sample validation. The last step is the simulation of the vaccine allocation scenarios discussed above. Pandemic metrics are monitored to evaluate the impacts of additional vaccines.

The simulation settings closely fit the observed pandemic data. Fig 2 illustrates the model fitting and out-of-sample validation for four selected countries. ",Yes,"The models will be parameterized using real-world data and validated through cross-validations.

When sex and age-disaggregated COVID-19 data were not available, we used the average disaggregation calculated from countries in the same WHO region.

The simulations also account for key behavioral indicators. Table 1 presents a list of those indicators, their definitions, and data sources

For an international model consisting of individual national models, it is critical to account for cross-country travel. Due to a lack of detailed travel data, we focus on the main effect of travel ing: bringing in new cases. The effect of travel can be quantified by the number of agent infected by imported cases, which is estimated by the weighted sum of COVID-19 prevalence in neighboring regions. The weights are computed as the inverse of flight hours between the capitals of regions, and they represent the effective proximity between regions.

Table 1. Selected simulation model parameter values and sources.

We first use the root mean square error (RMSE)- minimizing approach to find the parameter values that give the best fit for pandemic curves observed between 1/1/2020 and 6/30/2021. This stage is further divided into two periods. In the first period, the simulation was performed on disconnected regional models with the same default demographic characteristics. It is for setting the model for parameters that are significant at governing the shape and size of the outbreak curve. We used a grid search with 6300 combinations of parameters to find values that provide both in- and out-of-sample agreements with observed pandemic trajectories for each country. Each combination was repeated with 10 different random seeds, implying a final grid search among 63000 simulations for each region. In the second period, traveling, vaccination and regional demographic characteristics are added to the models, and to account for changes in the modelled curves that are introduced, parameters are slightly adjusted to ensure a good fit to the data curves. This fitting stage started when the vaccination rate reached 3% in the region or 5/31/2021, whichever came first.

Like in most large-scale simulation studies, the complexity of the model setting forbade us from mathematically quantifying the uncertainty in the results. As a sensitivity analysis, we re-ran the model 20 times using different random seeds. The choice of seeding did not pose a significant impact on our results since the results for each scenario varied only marginally across iterations. More importantly, the difference (in absolute and relative terms) between different scenarios remained nearly constant. That confirmed the robustness of our models, parameterization, and findings

The simulation settings closely fit the observed pandemic data

Therefore, the results should also be informative for areas with a population size much larger than the one in our study.

In our model, masking was assumed to reduce the probability of transmission by 70%, which was consistent with the estimated effectiveness of masks in the literature94,95. Our simulation model assumed either no masking for anyone or universal masking for everyone in different scenarios to explore the effect of masking. Partial masking can be assessed by assuming that a certain percentage of people would still wear masks when masking is not required, while a proportion of people would not wear masks even though masking is required. Another assumption in our model was that when masking was required, everyone, irrespective of vaccination status, needed to be masked. According to the CDC’s recommendation, people who are fully vaccinated can be unmasked in certain cercumstances76. However, our model’s assumption of universal masking would not affect the direction of our overall conclusions, for the effect of masks in our model was mainly through masking unvaccinated people since those vaccinated already had 90% protection from vaccines.

We assumed that each household member had contacts with all other members

Similar to existing studies in the literature, we assumed that the class size followed a Poisson distribution, due to the desirable properties of the Poisson distribution to model count data55

All students and the teacher of a class were assumed to have contact with one another within the class.

In the work environment, it is assumed that workers didn’t switch jobs, everyone worked five days a week unless being quarantined, and there was no distinction in job types, which implied that every job type had the same probability of contracting COVID.

For example, children were assumed to have a lower probability of transmitting the disease, and the transmission probability was reduced by 66% compared to that of adults62.

Based on the literature, our model assumed that patients with mild symptoms were diagnosed within at most three days after symptom onset, and then went into home isolation until recovery65

During home isolation, infected individuals would not transmit the disease through school, workplace, or community networks, but could still transmit the disease within household due to imperfect isolation, for which we assumed a 37% reduction in the transmission probability70

For simplicity, our model did not specify the types of vaccine and assumed an overall protection effect of 90% reduction in the transmission probability, based on early evidence on the protective effect of vaccines reflected in the reduction of hospitalization76,77.

In the analysis, we assumed the baseline daily vaccination rate was equal to vaccinating 0.6% of the adults and 0.5% of the school aged children, which was similar to the daily administered dosages in the U.S. in June 202127. In view of existing vaccine hesitancy, our model assumed the maximum vaccination coverage of 70% for adults and 40% for children",No,,No,,Two different disciplines,"Engineering, Life Sciences","Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Health Sciences","Department of Public Health Sciences, A210, Penn State College of Medicine, 90 Hope Drive, Suite 2200, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.

In the sensitivity analysis for vaccination efficacy, we found that higher vaccination efficacy was essential in reducing overall infections

In our sensitivity analysis, we also considered lower vaccine efficacies (ranging from 40 to 80%) to account for the reduced protection against emerging variants such as the Delta variant79. As the total number of vaccinated U.S. adults started to plateau27, our sensitivity analyses assessed different vaccination coverage levels among students (40%, 50%, 60%, and 70%). For a fair comparison, the targeted vaccination coverages in sensitivity analysis were reached at the same time (i.e., on day 100) by having different daily vaccination rates. In the sensitivity analysis on student vaccination coverage, the daily vaccination rate for adults remained at 0.6%.

Lastly, we performed sensitivity analyses on student total vaccination coverage and vaccine efficacy.

To assess the impact of vaccination on the overall COVID-19 transmission, we conducted sensitivity analyses on the maximum vaccination coverage among students and the vaccine efficacy, using Scenario 7 as an example.

The 7-day moving averages were used to produce smoother estimates of daily cases, so the first reported data point for the daily new cases was on day 7 after model initialization. Cumulative infections were reported for all environments together and stratified by household, school, workplace, and community. To quantify the uncertainty of stochastic simulation outcomes, we ran each scenario with 200 independent replications and reported the mean values and the 95% confidence intervals (mean±1.96*standard error)82. Lastly, we performed sensitivity analyses on student total vaccination coverage and vaccine efficacy

To assess the impact of vaccination on the overall COVID-19 transmission, we conducted sensitivity analyses on the maximum vaccination coverage among students and the vaccine efficacy, using Scenario 7 as an example

As shown in Fig. 6, the highest vaccination coverage (70%) with 0.7% daily vaccination rate among students led to the lowest cumulative infections on Day 250 (17,634.3 people per 100,000 population, 95% CI: 17,563.6–17,705.1), compared to the lowest vaccination coverage of 40% reached by a daily vaccination rate of 0.4% (18,441.8 people per 100,000 population, 95% CI 18,363.2–18,520.5). We found that a higher vaccination coverage (through a higher daily vaccination rate) in the student population reduced cumulative infections. Additionally, six different vaccine efficacies were evaluated to account for circumstances where the vaccine may have lower efficacy. According to the cumulative infection curves in Fig. 7, if the vaccine efficacy dropped to 40%, the cumulative infections on Day 250 could climb to as high as 33% of all population (32,828.5 people per 100,000 population, 95% CI 32,646.5–33,010.5)."

A household structure is created as follows: individuals who belong to households classed with the same type in the Census, and reside in the same locale, are linked together on the basis of age difference; single people below the age of 20 are assumed to live at home with one or two parents and siblings. Single people above the age of 20 are assumed to live independently, with a certain proportion co-habiting.

Active working-age agents are distributed among workplaces and linked to all co-workers at the same site as well as to a subset of colleagues who are assumed to be in closer, more frequent contact.

For school, we simply assume that during a day, agents have contacts with half of their classmates, which are randomly selected.

Furthermore, we assume that elderly agents have a reduced frequency of social encounters23,24. As for random contacts with strangers, we assume the number of contacts is a proportion p of the size of the area of residence (zone size range between 200-2700, with a mean of 1100 agents).

The probability of transmission during a contact with an agent in the network (βc) is higher than during a random contact with a stranger (βr ), as we assume that a contact with a stranger is of shorter duration and reduced closeness, translating in a reduced likelihood of transmission (Table 1).

Asymptomatic agents are able to infect others, but do not feel symptoms, and we assume that after the 3rd day of being infectious, infectiousness declines by 10% each day that follows28.

The model does not simulate nosocomial infection and always assumes the availability of hospital beds.

Symptomatic agents who seek testing are assumed to get tested between 1 and 3 days after the onset of symptoms, and results are determined within a day. We assume that a fixed number of tests is available: as agents are tested the stocks decrease and restocking takes place daily. 

To reflect the impact of influenza-like illness (ILI) on the testing system, we assume that over the course of any given week, 3.5% of the population experience ILI30, of which 30% will seek COVID-19 testing.

Limitations section
The unprecedented nature of technology-based contact tracing, and the novelty of the disease itself, make it difficult to include, parametrise and validate every aspect of the model based on hard evidence, not least because such evidence often does not yet exist. As for any modelling exercise, the generated results rely on the model’s assumptions that simplify reality. We based the disease course parameters on emerging evidence as specified in Supplementary Table S1, while the individual level transmission parameters were calibrated to match the aggregated reproduction number (R0 ) reported in the UK (Table 1). Validation of the contact patterns emerging in the model was based on a comparison with a UK-based survey (Fig. 3). With that, even with proper calibration of the ABM to reported infection rates (R0 ) it is possible that a different combination of individual based contact patterns and transmission rates occurring in different social environments could produce similar infection rates on the aggregated level35.

To address this issue, a sensitivity analysis for parameters affecting the viral spread is offered in the Supplementary Information section.

A final caveat relates to our assumptions that the CTA functions “perfectly” (no technical malfunctions or notification delays) and that test results are accurate and returned within one day.

(18 results)

In the model, we assume that this estimate applies to the community, workplace, and school networks, but not to households, where people are less likely to wear masks.

For all future projections, we assumed that schools and workplaces would be closed if more than five cases were detected. We also assumed that all identified contacts of confirmed cases would be tested regardless of symptoms; for individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms but no known history of contact with a case, we assumed 10% of individuals would seek a test during periods of low transmission (based on an analysis of testing data between Feb 1 and Aug 22, 2020), but once more than five cases are detected, aggressive testing campaigns would increase this proportion to 90% of individuals.

In the constant high compliance scenario, we assumed that the population would remain highly compliant with measures to stop transmission. We modelled this scenario by assuming the reduction in transmission risk in response to the detection of new locally transmitted cases in late July, 2020, represented a permanent shift in behaviour. 

In the increased complacency scenario... Following the detection of new cases, we assumed that the probability of someone with symptoms getting tested would increase as testing capacity is scaled up and that policy actions would be implemented comparable with those implemented in the past (ie, localised school and workplace closures following the detection of more than five locally transmitted cases), but we assumed that compliance with mask wearing and non-pharmaceutical interventions would not increase again.

The worst-case scenario could be partly mitigated if policy and behaviour respond dynamically to data showing that the daily number of locally acquired cases has exceeded a specified threshold, which in this scenario we assumed to be five cases

In the three behavioural scenarios, we assumed that during periods when no cases had been reported, demand for symptomatic testing would be low, with around 10% of individuals with symptoms seeking a test. 

Limitations

Our study has a number of limitations. Since we used an agent-based model, our results are based on underlying assumptions about the ways in which these agents interact. We modelled individual interactions over four networks (households, schools, workplaces, and community), but did not explicitly model large gatherings that could potentially become superspreading events. Such events are known to have potential for causing outbreaks.[24,25] Our estimates of the potential scale of an outbreak in Vietnam might therefore be conservative, especially considering events such as the 1-week Vietnamese Lunar New Year in early February, 2021, and the National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam in late January, 2021. Superspreading is also partly driven by overdispersion of viral load among individuals, a factor which is included in the model (eg, in Seattle [WA, USA], we estimated that 50% of transmissions were caused by around 10% of infected people).

Another limitation is that we assumed that the population is homogeneous in terms of behaviour and quarantine compliance. Generally, the omission of variability in model inputs also results in the omission of variability in the outputs. For example, when models assume that mask wearing reduces transmission risk for all individuals by a certain percentage, this actually incorporates a range of individual behavioural changes that might adjust individual-level transmission risk by varying amounts. The possibility of variation in a number of factors (eg, a single individual with a high viral load, a high number of contacts, who does not wear a mask) affects the risk of outbreaks.

Our model did not consider testing or contact tracing supply constraints, which are possible during a rapidly growing epidemic, especially for contact tracing programmes, and which might thus prevent tracing-based containment beyond a certain point. Additionally, we did not consider cost-effectiveness or economic consequences in this model.

Limitations

Our modeling approach has some limitations, primarily driven by assumptions that are
necessary but sometimes unclear based on our understanding of the disease and the population of interest. We relied on estimates from the literature for parameters related to disease transmission and testing sensitivity, which need to be continually updated as more is known in the scientific community. Our automated fitting approach relies on continuous prevalence estimates, which themselves require information on tests and test rationale that may not always be available.

We set our projection period to 14 days because of the many factors that could change during the projection period, including movement of individuals into/out of the population, changes in testing or site policies, or the identification of a new variant, which could lead to a divergence in predictions. If one of these events were to occur, the model assumptions would no longer be valid, and the model would therefore be likely to produce inaccurate predictions. To account for any of these events, the initial model parameters would have to be adjusted to reflect the updated knowledge; in the case of a new variant, we would expect to see an increase in test positivity, which, according to our suggested policies, would spur the employer or university to call for an updated fitting and projection. 

Test positivity is used as the primary metric of interest in our modeling, since we found this to be the main outcome that universities and employers are interested in monitoring and projecting. However, this means that regular testing and monitoring is needed in order for the agent-based model to provide meaningful projections, since shifts in testing rate and the population being tested could lead to differences in observed (and therefore, predicted) test positivity, even if there is no change in the underlying infection dynamics.

In future work, we’re hoping to improve our model’s ability to capture complexity at a workplace or university. Possible modifications include accounting for population changes, multiple circulating variants, and sub-locations/cohorts within a larger site. ",No,,Yes,"Model overview
We published the details of our original compartmental model in PLOS ONE [14]. This model was useful for prospective modeling, however in order to integrate the time-varying aspect of certain disease parameters, we needed to add additional complexity to our model. Additionally, a more flexible model allowed us to calculate outcome metrics that were aligned with how our clients were thinking about their risk.

For these reasons, we converted our original compartmental model into an agent-based
model that allowed us to simulate individual participants and tests... For details on the assumptions and parameters of the model, please refer to the original compartmental model paper [14].

To understand the importance of PPE, we conducted simulations with much

In developing and analyzing our model, we have made several simplifying assumptions. We assume no spillover between the COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 cohorts. In settings with understaffing, this assumption may be violated owing to compounding effects associated with outbreak-related stressors. As a conservative assumption, we assume no difference in viral load dynamics between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and ignore the persistent low viral loads after individuals are no longer infectious19: because we are looking at frequent testing strategies, we do not expect these viral load dynamics to affect our results. While we incorporate varying transmission risk by type of contact (resident-staff, resident-resident, and staff-staff), we do not explicitly model different staff roles, which may have different levels of risk. We made this simplification in order to make the results of this model more generalizable, as nursing home staff structure varies widely. We also assume that all individuals with symptoms are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and do not model symptoms from other diseases. Given low rates of other infectious diseases, such as flu, due in part to non-pharmaceutical interventions, we think this is a reasonable assumption.27 While we incorporate length of stay data for residents and temporary staff for staff who are isolating at home, we do not model staff turnover. Recent research suggests nursing home staff turnover may be very high.28 The impact of this assumption for the results of our model would depend heavily on the levels of immunity in new staff: new staff could come from other nursing homes that have experienced outbreaks or from the general community, which would likely have lower seroprevalence. In addition, available data are from before the COVID-19 pandemic, and there may be large heterogeneity in how the pandemic affected staff employment trends. In an effort to minimize the implications of this assumption on our results, we limit our analysis to only 3 months.

In the immunity-based staffing intervention, staff who had recovered from COVID-19 were assumed to have protective immunity and were assigned to work in the non–COVID-19 cohort, while susceptible staff worked in the COVID-19 cohort and were assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment.

Residents were assumed to have a lower probability of asymptomatic infection than staff owing to age and other risk factors (eTable 1 in the Supplement)

We made the conservative assumption that new residents continually replaced those who died or were discharged, keeping capacity at 100% and leading to a constant inflow of susceptible residents

We assumed transmission only occurred on contact and did not consider strictly airborne transmission

With the exception of roommates, who were modeled explicitly, we assumed homogeneous (ie, random) mixing

We made the conservative assumption of the same viral load distributions for asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.17

We assumed the sensitivity of the tests only depended on viral dynamics and did not incorporate other factors, such as variations in sample quality

Because we assumed that the contacts in nursing homes are necessary, our interventions did not reduce contacts but rather changed with whom those contacts occurred.

The immunity-based staffing intervention prioritized placing recovered staff, who we assumed were immune, in the non–COVID-19 cohort, leaving susceptible staff to work in the COVID-19 cohort. Importantly, we assumed staff working in the COVID-19 cohort were provided adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) that reduced infection risk

In all scenarios, we assumed that symptom-based testing was conducted to confirm infection. Individuals who were waiting on test results were assumed to behave as normal unless they experienced symptoms before receiving results, in which case residents were moved to the COVID-19 cohort and staff were sent home. Based on the current parameters of these tests, antigen testing was assumed to have a higher limit of detection (LOD) and consequently lower sensitivity than PCR but returned results immediately, whereas PCR had a 2-day delay (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement).

In the baseline simulations, we assumed perfect specificity, such as through the use of rapid orthogonal molecular– or antigen-based confirmatory tests. In sensitivity analyses, we relaxed this assumption among staff and assumed a 2-day delay in confirmatory testing, during which time staff were replaced by temporary staff. We further explored variations in the sensitivity of the antigen tests and the turnaround time of the PCR tests (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement)

This intervention hinges on the assumption that recovered staff are protected against reinfection. Access to appropriate PPE and training on proper use are required for it to be both feasible and ethical. Because we assume a constant rate of community introduction, the change in staff infections within the nursing home associated with contact-targeted interventions is often compensated for by infections acquired in the community.",No,https://github.com/rek160/ NursingHomeABM,No,,One discipline,Life Sciences,Biological and Biomedical Sciences,"Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Each individual i infected at time ti can either be classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic based on the age-specific asymptomatic rate [18] of SARS-CoV-2 Φasymp. For symptomatic infections, we assign the time delay from infection to symptom onset τincu by drawing from the incubation period distribution Pincu(τ) [19]

secondary infections caused by i), by drawing from a neg ative binomial distribution NB(R0, k), where the mean of the negative binomial distribution R0 is the basic repro duction number (population average of Ri ), and k is the dispersion parameter of negative binomial distribution, capturing the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (we provide R0 and k values specific for Omicron later in the “Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages” section). Therefore, individual I would cause a total of Ri secondary infections. We assume the shape of each infected individual’s infectiousness profile follows the distribution of the generation interval GI(τ). Tus, the timing of transmission τij from individual i to individual j∈{Ri } is given by τij=tj−ti , where ti and tj are the i and j’s timing of infection, and τij is drawn from the generation interval distribution GI(τ). We recursive simulate the onward spreading of secondary infections through multiple generations until the 30th day after virus introduction or the daily number of infections reaches 10,000.

Moreover, even though the consortium has access to the most accurate and up-to date data about the epidemic in Austria, a lot of information required for valid epidemiological forecasting is not available or only available with considerable delay, since adequate reporting systems are not in place; e.g., the fraction of undetected persons due to asymptomatic disease progression. Further, our forecast is based on simulation models which are generally subject to errors that come from abstraction and simplification of the real system.

The model is based on a validated population model of Austria including demographic processes like death, birth, and migration15",Yes,"In addition to these point estimates, we also provided upper and lower bounds for these numbers at various levels of confidence. These upper bounds of the hospital bed forecasts served as a guidance system for the regional hospital managers, allowing them to estimate how many beds should be reserved for COVID-19 patients if they were willing to accept a given level of risk. These forecasts have been published each week on the homepage of the Ministry of Health23

Although the three models use different parameters and parametrization routines, they are calibrated using the same data to generate weekly forecasts

Model parameters are calibrated using a numerical optimization procedure that is separately performed in multiple time windows corresponding to phases with different regimes of NPIs. Whether changes in NPIs indeed led to substantial changes in behaviour was inferred from mobility data to identify such calibration time windows29,30

The model input consists of a time-line of modelled NPIs; parameters are calibrated using a modified bisection method. For generation of the weekly forecasts, the model is fitted to the 7 day incidence of the new confirmed cases of the last 21 days including a nowcasting correction for the last week to supplement for subsequent registrations. Results are gathered via Monte-Carlo simulations as the point wise sample mean of multiple simulation runs. Due to the large number of agents in the model, eight simulation runs are used which are sufficient to have the sample mean approximate the real unknown mean with an error of less than 1% with 95% confidence (estimated by the Gaussian stopping as introduced in ref. 31). The model considers uncertainty with respect to the stochastic perturbations in the model by tracing the standard deviation of the Monte-Carlo simulations. Parameter uncertainty is considered in form of manually defined best and worst case scenarios.

Different averaging procedures were considered to generate the joined forecast from the three individual forecasts. These included the point-wise arithmetic and geometric mean as well as an adaptive weighting procedure wherein the timeseries for each model contributes with weights proportional to the accuracy of its most recent forecasts. This strategy was adapted from previous work 24,37. The following three strategies have been evaluated in terms of their forecast error.

Length of stay determines out ow. Admission rates are scaled in order to t the current occupancy in all federal states. The scaling parameter (one for each federal state) can thus be interpreted as an effective hospitalization rate. Model parameters were initially extracted from literature38 and subsequently calibrated to observational data to better t the observed time series

Confidence intervals for forecasts. Confidence intervals (CIs) for both case numbers of the harmonized model and hospital occupancy are derived from the empirical forecast error of each prognosis day. More specific, we retrospectively evaluate the ratio of the consolidated forecast and the observed seven-day-incidence rate of confirmed cases for each day over the forecast interval. The upper and lower limits of the 68% and 95% CIs used for the reporting of our forecasts are derived from the corresponding percentiles of the empirical distribution of the observed forecast error. It is assumed that forecasting errors can be reasonably approximated by a log-normal distribution that is independent of the starting level of case numbers, that the variance increases with the forecast horizon, and that the forecast error of the first and second day of the forecast is skewed because increases due to delayed reporting are more likely than decreases in case numbers due to backdating. We therefore consider the relative logarithmic forecast error tuples i,h where i denotes the number of the prognosis, and h denotes the forecast horizon. These tuples are evaluated in a 2-dimensional kernel-density estimation (KDE). The resulting density function is evaluated at slices of h=1,2,…,H, where H is the last day of the forecast. 0.025, 0.16, 0.84 and 0.975 percentiles give thresholds for the error bands in the case number projections for h. For the confidence intervals of the ICU and hospital occupancy we additionally take the occupancy on the first prognosis day into account because the fluctuations of the occupancy numbers played a much higher role for the error than the parameter uncertainty.

Forecasting error evaluation. Forecasts are evaluated at the weekly official meetings of the consortium. A list of all dates (as well as officially reported forecasts) can be found online23. To quantify the error of the case forecasts, the total number of reported and projected new cases since the last meeting are compared using data as reported on the day of the meeting. For example, the forecast harmonized on April 3, 2020 was evaluated on the meeting on April 10th by comparing the total number of new cases reported between April 3rd and April 9th with the projected ones. To avoid bias, relative and not absolute differences and errors are taken into account.

Fig. 1 Rolling combined and consolidated out-of-sample forecasts for the 7 day incidence rate of confirmed cases in Austria. We show the weekly predictions from the three different models, their arithmetic average with it corresponding CI, and the actual case numbers. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 1.

A critical point was the prognosis for the week until October 25, highlighted in yellow in Fig. 1. There, the consolidated forecast clearly underestimated the actual rise in confirmed cases. The forecasts made in the weeks thereafter were more accurate, however, the CI strongly increased due to the less accurate forecasts from the first half of October

In Fig. 2, we compare the model-specific forecast error with the forecast error of the consolidated model, the incidence and the effective reproduction number in Austria. In April 2020, agreement amongst the three models is typically stronger than the agreement with the data, meaning if one model over- or underestimated the actual trend, so did the other models. After the summer, agreement between the three models was larger than in the early phases of the pandemic. Comparing the upper and lower part of this image also shows that none of the models anticipated a spontaneous rise in Reff in combination with a large number of daily cases in August/September and October. This was particularly well visible at end of October (see the dotted lines in Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the violin representation in Fig. 3, which shows the relative differences between forecasts and reported data of all forecasts ever made, indicates that no persistent systematic over- or underestimation occurs while it cannot be ruled out that such systematic aberrations might have occurred over smaller periods of time. We investigated the performance of different averaging procedures that weigh models according to their past perfor mance in terms of their relative difference and error, see Methods. The results are summarized in Table 1. Performance weighting procedures yielded only a marginal improvement over simple averaging in terms of forecast accuracy. This further corroborates that agreement amongst the model forecasts is typically higher than their agreement with the observed case numbers.

Fig. 2 Evaluation of the forecast performance. Daily new confirmed cases and estimated Reff 9 (top panel) and forecasting performance (relative difference, bottom panel) of the individual models and the harmonized mean are shown for 72 forecasts. Weeks in which the forecasts substantially underestimated the actual case numbers (vertical dotted lines) tend to coincide with steep increases in Reff. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 2

Table 1 Forecast accuracy with different model harmonization strategies.

We consider a naive arithmetic mean (strategy “naive”), geometric mean (“geometric”) as well as an adaptive method (""continuous”) which weights the models according to their recent performance. The table displays harmonization function as well as relative errors for selected weeks and a summary of the forecasts for weeks 2–86. None of the harmonization strategies stands out.

Fig. 3 Evaluation of the forecasting performance for federal states. The distribution of relative differences over all 72 forecasts to the reported data for Austria (AT) and all nine federal states (AT-1 to AT-9) is shown. Since the mean relative differences are close to zero, no persistent systematic over or underestimation of the cases occurs. For large federal states such as Lower Austria (AT-3) and Vienna (AT-9), forecasts are more reliable. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 3.

Fig. 4 Forecasting bed usage. Rolling combined and consolidated out-of-sample forecasts for the number of intensive care beds currently in use for COVID-19 patients including corresponding CI, the actual numbers of beds occupied, and 33% of total ICU capacity as a reference. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 4

Fig. 5 Example for a reporting template of our out-of-sample forecasts. The visual reports consist of four panels. First, we report the daily number of cases in absolute terms and the weekly case numbers per 100 000 population as well as the forecasts for the weekly case numbers, including CIs. Additional panels show the the effective reproduction number and the forecasts for intensive and normal care beds occupancy with COVID-19 patients along with the corresponding CIs.

Due to the multiplicative growth of uncertainties in epidemiological models, accurate forecasts are typically only possible over a time horizon of several days39–42. There is no meaningful way to estimate the uncertainty for long-term scenarios that span over several weeks, months or even years.

Further, our forecast is based on simulation models which are generally subject to errors that come from abstraction and simplification of the real system. Through the harmonized handling of three models with entirely different approaches we attempted to reduce such structural uncertainties

We consider both essential and non-essential workers—which represent 35% and 65% of company employees—as well as the interruption of leisure activities.
► Mobility restrictions. We introduce policies that restrict independently the two types of intercity movements: short and long distance.
► Face masks. We have introduced the use of surgical and ffp2-grade face masks when used by the general population or by targeted groups, such as the elderly.

All the strategies we implement are parameterisable by the number of daily tests, the minimum testing frequency (ie, the minimum time between two tests of the same individual), the quarantine time and the percentage of quarantine breakers.

Figure 1 captures in its top part the transition between infection stages for individuals who were neither vaccinated nor previously infected. We assume that these individuals have become immune to COVID-19 and they will not become reinfected during the entire simulation time. 

In figure 2, we assume that the first dose is administered at time zero. During the first 12 days,19 the vaccine does not provide any protection, while during the next 8 days the efficacy of the vaccine increases linearly to 52%. 

Limitations

Strengths and weaknesses
     EpiGraph also has limitations, some easier to address in the future than others: (1) We do not consider attributes such as previous pathologies that we now know that may come into play when we evaluate the risk of developing COVID-19 severe symptoms. (2) In the transportation model, the movement of individuals between cities depends only on the distance between the cities and the population size. In our experiments, we only model the largest urban regions; we could incorporate smaller cities and towns, including rural regions. (3) A recovered person (including those that have had COVID-19 at the start of the simulation) is considered immune to reinfection for the period one 1 year; this seems to depend on the COVID-19 strain and would require a waning immunity and reinfection model. (4) Infection is achieved in our model via social contacts (sharing the same space); infection through third media such as surfaces is not considered. (5) The agents representing the individuals do not have adaptive behaviour depending on external factors, for example, news, other people’s behaviour, etc.

Furthermore, stemming from an integer number of individuals, the output of the differential equation leads to real numbers which are delicate to interpret.

We presented a model for modelling virus transmission (in particular, SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, which causes COVID-19, but it is more generally applicable) in supermarkets based on an agent-based model of customers traversing from zone to zone and being exposed to potential virus infection when in the same zone as an infected customer.

In our infection mechanism, we assume susceptible customers become infected proportional to the time they spent with infectious customers. We assume that the main mode of transmission is direct transmission via respiratory droplets and neglect airborne transmission and fomite transmission.

We assume that each basket corresponds to a single customer (rather than groups of customers).

We use this parameter and assume that the mean contact duration is15 minutes to obtain a rate of transmission to be β =2.11 × 10−8/15 =1.41 × 10−9 per minute. (We assume that the probability of transmission is proportional to the contact duration).

In other words, we assume that the one-way layout does not change the order in which customers buy their items; it merely changes the route that they take between items (or between an item and an entrance/till).

Limitations section
Our model comes with a number of limitations. Firstly, a customer’s path in our model does not depend on other customers, whereas we expect a customer’s path to change depending on, for example, the crowdedness of other zones.

We also assume that the chance of infection is proportional to the exposure time, whereas in reality it may be non-linear (e.g., represented by a logistic function to model infectious dosage).

Therefore, we anticipate our point estimate for β may not be very accurate, and the concrete results that we presented may have limited generalisation power.",Yes,https://github.com/fabianying/covid19-supermarket-abm,No,,Two different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Industry",Data processing,"Quantitative Research, G-Research, London, United Kingdom

Studies where JUNE is applied to different settings are forthcoming [85].

Similarly, modifications to the disease layer will allow application of the JUNE framework for a different disease or, possibly, even a range of competing diseases.",Yes, England,Considered and imposed,"On 16 March 2020, the UK Government encouraged people with COVID-19 symptoms to quarantine in their household for 7 days and all those in their household to quarantine for 14 days from symptom onset. We assume that compliance with this measure varies with time as people become more aware of the dangers of COVID-19.

To account for this, we increase the symptomatic and household compliance with quarantine to be double their fitted value. In addition, the UK Government strongly suggested that people over the age of 70 were to shield, from 16 March 2020. As in the case of quarantine, we assume people become more compliant with this policy over time and that the initial compliance with the shielding policy for this age bracket increased from 20% in the first week to 70% afterwards.

We derived the compliance with mask wearing from a YouGov survey [61], and we further stratify the results by social environment or locations. Specifically, we assume complete (100%) compliance with mask wearing during commuting, 50% in care homes and no compliance in pubs, schools or in the household. Compliance with mask wearing in grocery stores is assumed to be at 50% before 24 July 2020, after which we assume complete compliance given the change in government regulations.

In general, we focus on the wearing of masks by non-healthcare workers in settings outside the home and estimate mask effectiveness, E, to be 50% [60], irrespective of the specific location.",Stay at home; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Get medical treatment; Practice good hygiene,"We model the impact of the former set of measures, social distancing, increased hygiene and mask wearing, through multiplicative reductions in the location-specific contact-intensity parameters, β(L,g), see figure 15 for an example.

In JUNE, shielding is realized similar to quarantine: vulnerable individuals usually defined by their age or other characteristics—stay at home and do not interact with others outside their household.

In terms of disease progression, the model captures how likely individuals are to experience symptoms with varying severity, to be hospitalized, to be admitted to intensive care, or to die, as well as the timings associated with these events.

Since we already assume low intensity parameters in hospitals due to the significant amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) being worn in these scenarios, we do not apply any additional mask wearing in these settings.",Yes,"We fit the national compliance, C(N), with social distancing between 24 March and 11 May 2020 in the range 20–100% when fitting the rest the parameters (see §7).

We derived the compliance with mask wearing from a YouGov survey [61], and we further stratify the results by social environment or locations.

We therefore use this literature as a benchmark, assuming on average 1 m social distancing, E = 0.5, and fit the effects of social distancing to data where possible (see §6.3).

Social interactions in various settings are modelled through parameters informed by social mixing matrices derived from surveys such as PolyMod [10] and the BBC Pandemic project [15].", ,, ,, ,, ,, ,,No,JUNE Python package,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"The calibration to observed data from the actual spread of SARS-CoV-2 is then limited to how the virus is transmitted in the community through person-to-person ‘contacts’ (in the sense of sufficient proximity and timing to transmit). 

Based on the current enrolment requirements for the UK, we assume that children between the ages 0–19 can attend school, with mandatory attendance between 5 and 18.

In addition, we have identified five additional settings which we assume are similarly relevant for the spread of the disease and have a similar level of social mixing: visits to pubs or restaurants (pubs), cinema visits (cinemas), shopping (groceries), visiting friends or relatives in their homes (household visits), or visiting family members in care homes (care home visits).

In our age-averaging, we implicitly assume that the number and character of teacher–student contacts is independent of the age of the students. Student–student contacts are assumed to be most frequent within a class or year group, and fall off steeply with the age difference.

Both the factor α(t), which we assume to be the same for all locations, and the location- and group-specific contact intensities, β(L,g), are taken from fits to data.

For the former, we assume that their seroprevalence by age is identical to the population group aged 18, while for the latter, we set a flat seroprevalence by age at 11% value as reported in the Vivaldi report of the UK Department of Health and Social Care [44] in the beginning of July 2020.

The number of deaths in care homes reported in [53] is only reported by age until late June, so we assume that the distribution does not change until 13 July 2020.

No social distancing is assumed between household members. We derived the compliance with mask wearing from a YouGov survey [61], and we further stratify the results by social environment or locations. Specifically, we assume complete (100%) compliance with mask wearing during commuting, 50% in care homes and no compliance in pubs, schools or in the household.

We assume that compliance with this measure varies with time as people become more aware of the dangers of COVID-19. Between the 16 March and 23 March 2020 (i.e. the week leading up to the nationwide ‘lockdown’) we fit compliance with the quarantine policy of those symptomatic to be between 5 and 45%, and the probability that the rest of the household of a symptomatic individual complies is set to the same fitted value. 

While the timings of this week-long holiday varies across the country, we assume all schools share the same holiday period 26 October—30 October 2020.

Since many of these venues were permitted to reopen from 4 July 2020, we assumed all venues reopen at this point.

The calibration to observed data from the actual spread of SARS-CoV-2 is then limited to how the virus is transmitted in the community through person-to-person ‘contacts’ (in the sense of sufficient proximity and timing to transmit). This component of the infection is calibrated to the spatio-temporal development of hospitalizations and casualties during the COVID–19 outbreak in England, starting in early March 2020. 

To ensure a close match to real-world dynamics, summary information on the virtual population is calibrated to equivalent observed summary data. 

We calculate the distance travelled to work by sex, in figure 27, and we see that men are more likely to travel further to work in our model than women. Our findings are in reasonably good agreement with the survey [30] and serve as an independent validation of our model.

Te good agreement between JUNE and the DfE data before 1 June
2020, is of particular note since this option was available only for children where all parents in the household were classified as key workers. This serves as an implicit partial validation of our method
of selecting which individuals are key workers, as well as the household and company sector distribution algorithms. ",Yes,"95% CI

Even more challenging is that the substantial uncertainties present imply that we may not even want to optimize for a single ‘best fit to data’ as it may have limited statistical relevance, but instead search for the set of all input parameter values that give acceptable matches between model output and observed data, thereby fully capturing the induced parametric uncertainty.

Due to the emulators’ speed, they are ideal for global parameter exploration. This is performed by constructing an implausibility measure that gives the distance between the emulator’s expected JUNE model output and the observed data we are trying to match, standardized by all the major uncertainties present: observational errors, emulator uncertainty and structural model discrepancy, the latter being a direct acknowledgement that the model is an imperfect representation of reality (see appendix E for details).

While here we have performed a provisional exploration of the parameter space as part of the model development, for a full uncertainty analysis of the JUNE model, including the emulator-driven generation of full probabilistic forecasts incorporating all major sources of uncertainty, see [71]."

So, on a daily basis the infected S-pool is selected, and some of them are sent to the quarantine via Bernoulli toss, determined by their probability of symptomatic expression.

Test screening is implemented via a preset number of tests per day to be randomly conducted on non-quarantined individuals.

3.1.1. Typical outbreak patterns and parameter sensitivity: baseline cases section

To combat this uncertainty, it would be useful to explore a range of values for the environmental risk factors. We do not, however, perform an exhaustive analysis of the parameter-space, but explore a few scenarios to show how a range of risk factors can be useful in interpreting various strategies to combat outbreaks. Specifically, we focused on environmental risk factors {𝑎𝑐, 𝑎𝑑 , 𝑎𝑠} , assigned 3 values, low, medium, high, (See Table 1), along with the classroom distance scale for three values (d = {1.5, 2, 2.5}).

An ensemble of 50 simulations were run for each combination of parameters with results presented in Figure 5(a)."
366,Phillips 2021,Model-based projections for COVID-19 outbreak size and student-days lost to closure in Ontario childcare centres and primary schools,Consensus,Yes,"Our objective is to use agent-based modelling to project the impact of student-educator (or in the case of childcare 
centres, child–educator) ratios and sibling grouping strategies on outbreaks of COVID-19 and student-days lost to classroom closure in a hypothetical childcare centre and primary school.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",Yes,These results are also relevant for authorities facing the possibility of re-closing schools in light of an impending resurgence of COVID-19 due to a second or third pandemic wave.,Yes,Canada,Considered and imposed,"To account for the use of safety measures within the school (and the compliance of children and teachers with best practices), we consider low and high transmission rate scenarios (as seen in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). [authors use the transmission level as indication if NPIs are implemented or not]",Stay at home; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Practice good hygiene,"Scenarios varied the student‑to‑educator ratio (15:2, 8:2, 7:3), family clustering (siblings together versus random assignment) and time spent in class. We also evaluated a primary school setting (with student‑educator ratios 30:1, 15:1 and 8:1), including cohorts that alternate weekly.

The low transmission rate scenario represents reduced transmission rates in children (vs. adults) and/or highly effective infection control through consistent use of high-effectiveness masks, physical distancing and disinfection protocols (see “Methods” section for details). Similarly, the high transmission rate scenario represents inconsistent use (or non-use) of masks, ignoring distancing guidelines, improper hygiene and all other factors facilitating disease spread. To see the effect of shorter schooling durations, we also consider a ‘reduced time’ scenario in which students spend less time in class.

Our baseline assumption was to assume asymptomatic infected individuals who are sent home due to closure of a classroom are able to self-isolate.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
In total, the permutations on student-educator ratios, transmission rate assumptions, siblings versus non-sibling groupings, alternating cohorts and schooling duration yielded a number of scenarios detailed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.

Our baseline assumption was to assume asymptomatic infected individuals who are sent home due to closure of a classroom are able to self-isolate. This assumption is conservative, since inability to self-isolate under these circumstances would result in higher projected outbreak sizes.

All groups of individuals (households and rooms) in the model are assumed to be well-mixed.

In the model, some children in the population are enrolled as students in the institution and assigned a classroom based on assumed scenarios of classroom occupancy while some adults are assigned educator/caretaker roles in these classroom (again dependent on the occupancy scenario being tested).

We note that Statistics Canada data only report family sizes of 1, 2 or 3 children: the relative proportions for 3+ children were obtained by assuming that 65% of families of 3+ children had 3 children, 25% had 4 children, 10% had 5 children, and none had more than 5 children. Each educator was assumed to be a member of a household that did not have children attending the school. Again using census data, we assumed that 36% of educators live in homes with no children, where an individual lives alone with probability 0.282, while households hosting 3, 4, 5, 6, and seven adults occur with probability 0.345, 0.152, 0.138, 0.055, 0.021 and 0.009 respectively.

We assumed an under-ascertainment factor of 8.45 based on an empirical estimate of under-reporting45, meaning there are actually 8.45 times more cases than reported in Ontario, giving rise to ¬S = 1.16 × 10−4 per day; ¬N was set to 2 · ¬S .

Hence, we assumed that βC = αCβH , with a baseline value of αC = 0.75 based on more dispersed contacts expected in the larger room group, although we varied this assumption in sensitivity analysis.

To determine βO we assumed that βO = αOβC where αO ≪ 1 to account for the fact that students spend less time in common areas than in their rooms. 

We assumed that p = 0.05 and thus αO = 0.0025.

We assume that parents in households with more than one child will decide to enroll their children in the same institution for convenience with probability ξ = 80% , so that each additional child in multi-child households will have probability 1 − ξ of not being assigned to the institution being modelled.

As in the “Parameterisation” section, we assume that 36% of educators live in adult-only houses, while the other educators live in houses with children, both household sizes following the distributions outlined in the “Parameterisation” section.

Simplifying assumptions. Our model makes simplifying assumptions that may influence its predictions. For instance, we assume that classrooms are homogeneously mixing and did not take social structure into account.

We also assumed that public health authorities will respond to a confirmed case by closing the classroom, although in practice, they may keep the class running if they think the case does not represent an infection risk to children or adults.

Other simplifying assumptions are mentioned in the “Discussion” section.

The assumed main conditions in the initial infector % (Fig. 11-A, Fig. 11-B and Fig. 11-C) can generally lead to the possibility to control the contagion spreading by using surgical masks.

Meanwhile, FFPk masks generally have a similar impact for all the assumed main conditions in the initial infector % to date this paper is written.

""sensitivity analyses"" section",Yes,"We simulated SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in each country under a range of average effective reproduction number (i.e., Re = 0.9, 1.2 (doubling time = 6–9 days), 1.5 (doubling time = 3–5 days), and 2.0 (doubling time = 1–3 days)) during the first week of each simulation.

For each set of simulations, we assumed three vaccination coverage: 10%, 50% and 90%. We randomly assigned vaccination status across the simulated population but assumed that vaccination was age-tiered such that the older individuals were vaccinated first. For comparability between countries and as a simplification, we assumed that protection rates against infection and severe disease were 29% and 70%, respectively, which were based on the more conservative, lower average estimates of vaccine effectiveness against BA.1 across different vaccines (i.e., mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine) and doses (i.e., 1–3 doses)19–21

We also randomly assigned 20% of the population to have a 40% increase in relative risk to developing severe disease because of pre-existing comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, people living with HIV, etc.)28,29.

Fold increase in proportion of severe cases averted relative to no symptomatic testing restrictions when Re ≥ 1.5, across all vaccination coverages and countries simulated: 100 tests/100 K/day, median 4.9-fold (IQR = 3.3–6.4); 500 tests/100 K/day, median 3.2-fold (IQR = 2.4–5.1)) and in turn, deaths as well (Figure S10). Of the test distribution strategies simulated in this study, restricting testing to high-risk-groups-only also substantially reduced the number of tests performed per antiviral distributed to median of 6 tests (IQR = 5–8 tests; Figure S11). In contrast, a median 20 tests (IQR = 15–33 tests)

As such, increasing vaccination coverage did not lower antiviral need substantially (median 0.93-fold change (IQR = 0.70–1.00) when vaccination coverage increased from 10% to 90%). Conversely, the amount of antivirals distributed depends on Re (median 2.60-fold change (IQR = 0.97–4.35) when Re increases from 0.9 to 2.0), country demographics (median 1.72-fold change (IQR = 1.02–2.04) when distributing antivirals in Georgia relative to Zambia), testing rates (median 4.31-fold change (IQR = 1.49–5.77) when increasing from 100 to 500 tests/100 K/ day), and how tests were targeted (median 2.57-fold change (IQR = 1.52–4.55) when testing only high-risk as opposed to all symptomatic individuals)

As an approximation, we assumed that vaccinated individuals, while still tiered by age, cluster among members from the same household.

The lower seeding condition also led to a fair proportion of severe cases averted at 10 tests/ 100 K/day but with large uncertainty (i.e., wider error bars in Figure S19A) and mostly only when Re < 1 or at high vaccination coverage (90%)

Across all countries and Re, we estimated that an additional 24%-67% of the population must be vaccinated to reduce the number of severe cases by half without antivirals."

RL agents learn from the consequences of their actions, such as maintaining physical distance, wearing masks, or modifying their behavior in response to the evolving pandemic conditions. Over time, the RL agents fine-tune their strategies to maximize the objective, often focused on minimizing infections or overcrowding. This adaptive learning process is critical for optimizing control policies because it accounts for the dynamic nature of the pandemic and individual behavior. RL agents can adapt their responses based on changing circumstances, thereby improving the effectiveness of control measures. Through RL, our aimis to provide a clear demonstration of how specific control policies can be identified and applied in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights into pandemic control within university campuses and similar semi-enclosed environments.",Yes,Repast Suite,Yes,ODD,Assumptions; Limitations,"In the transmission process, our assumptions regarding the probabilities governing the spread of COVID-19 across the campus are derived from the existing literature, which is based on well-established research and forms the foundation for modeling how the virus propagates throughout the university campus.

It is guided by the existing literature available during the early stages of the virus’s emergence, and our assumptions are grounded in established research, shaping our understanding of how COVID-19 spreads across a campus.

Certainly, infected people can either die or survive, as it greatly depends on the patient’s condition. Discernibly, this epidemic system and related agent interactions are assumed to be governed by random processes that can be fitted to probabilistic distributions

Accordingly, we assumed in our model that this period can be specified in terms of the incubation period (time between the exposition and symptoms’ onset) by shifting it 2.4 days to the past. In addition, Lauer et al. [68] estimate the distribution of the incubation period as a Lognormal distribution with parameters µ and s, as depicted in Equation (3), which is the distribution that we considered in our model.

As previously mentioned, at the time of this study, it was assumed that an infected individual would either die or make a full recovery, with the latter resulting in complete immunity 

Considering that, we assumed, based on Liuetal.[70], that the death rates are 15% for patients with severe symptoms and 50%for critical subjects

It is assumed that neither death nor recovery follows a constant time duration after infection. Instead, the time until discharge is considered a random variable with positive values.

We operate under the assumption that individuals within the community are rational and prioritize avoiding infection. This inherent drive motivates them to adapt their behaviors to minimize exposure to potential risks willingly. It is important to note that in our scenario, agents act solely based on their personal experiences and not due to external influences.

For modeling disease transmission, we rely on established research, which shapes our assumptions about how COVID-19 spreads across the campus.

Additionally, these studies have commonly ignored individual heterogeneity and multifaceted interactions between individuals. They commonly assume that contacts are static and interactions are not necessarily spatially related. Moreover, there is evidence of a consensus among agent-based modelers about traditional modeling methods lacking the necessary tools to understand such complex systems thoroughly [20,34,35].

In the transmission process, our assumptions regarding the probabilities governing the spread of COVID-19 across the campus are derived from the existing literature, which is based on well-established research and forms the foundation for modeling how the virus propagates throughout the university campus

The preceding results show that the learning-lacking scenario does not comply with the social distancing policy. Thus, a design of experiments is aimed to determine the effect of RL-based social distancing with different sets of parameters. Truly, it would be ideal to examine a vast array of parameter settings. Still, extensive simulation times constrain the number of trials to perform in a reasonable time and with limited computing resources.

Moreover, focusing only on social distancing may not include all important aspects of disease control, and our study’s limited timeframe may have hindered the detection of significant impacts from this specific measure.

First, the social network was not based on field data on human interaction collected in the KSA, but created using common characteristics found studying human in teractions in different settings merged with KSA demo graphic data. The movement of people in the country was simulated using a gravity model based on general movement rules and not from movement data of the KSA population, such as mobile phone data. The use of approximations to represent the interaction of the KSA population may have impacted the precision of our model in forecasting the progression of the epidemic in the country. Second, the transmission of the virus was calibrated using weekly reported cases. Case reporting has not shown to be consistent in many countries, thereby underestimating the size of COVID-19 epi demics. Thus, the precision of the IBM-KSA prediction was linked to the performance of the KSA case reporting system. Third, our model was developed before the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant was identified and prevalent in KSA; the first KSA case due to the delta variant was reported in August 2021, which is outside the time period of our model.

Without NPIs, the KSA could have reported 4,824,065 (95% CI: 3,673,775–6,335,423) cases by June 2021. The IBM-KSA showed that mandatory mask-wearing and physical distancing saved 39,452 lives (95% CI: 26,641–44,494)

The simulated COVID-19 epidemics based on each scenario were used to estimate the effective reproduce number (Rt) across a forecasted period

We calculated the hospitalization and fatality rates for KSA [23] to determine the number of infectious individuals who also would be at risk of being hospitalized or dying. The transition from one status to another is a function of pathogen characteristics (e.g., virulence, incubation period, infectious period, hospitalization, and fatality rate [Additional file 1]) and interaction among individuals (only for S to I) [46–49, 54]. The fraction of symptomatic cases is set equal to 20% [47]

All scenarios included a reduction of people interaction outside their household members equal to 15% [34] to represent changes in movement behavior after the lockdown had been lifted.

The probability of infecting other individuals was reduced by 40% when an infectious individual was wearing a mask [25]. Physical distancing reduced the transmission between individuals by 70% [55]. These scenarios represent the NPIs already in use in KSA. We tested four scenarios, because we do not have data on population adherence to mandatory mask-wearing and physical distancing, or of the effectiveness of the contact tracing. A recent study showed that approximately 50% of people follow physical distancing guidance [56] and more than80%wear masks outside their homes [57].

Additionally, two globally accepted restrictive COVID-19 interventions (i.e., using face masks and vaccination) are analyzed by CoDiSS, and their results are compared to our suggested non-restrictive interventions.",Yes,"To accurately simulate the impact of these two interventions, the rate of public compliance with the mandates (in the United Kingdom) and their effectiveness of each are extracted from the literature. An extensive interview survey in Ireland Kearney et al. (2022) with 11,171 participants reveals that 67.3% of the respondents used face masks in shops and supermarkets, and only 17.8% consistently used face masks at work. 

According to the Office for National Statistics (Office of National Statistics, 2023), 70.2% of eligible British citizens are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and the aggregated effectiveness of vaccines provided to the public is [50−60%] in preventing severe cases of COVID-19 (Agency, 2023). Furthermore, CoDiSS accounts for the decrease in the viral load of the disease in vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated individuals, where the viral load of COVID-19 decreases by 4.8 folds in vaccinated individuals (Puhach et al., 2022).

Considerably, the compliance rate used in this paper corresponds to the vaccination program administered in the United Kingdom, which is a pioneer in COVID-19 vaccine development and has one of the highest rates of vaccination (Pettersson, Manley, Hernandez, McPhillips, & Arias, 2023).

The theoretical limitation of this research relates to CoDiSS (i.e., the ABM framework) since it only addresses the aerosol transmission of contagious diseases and ignores all other transmission routes. Expanding the scope of CoDiSS to encompass the transmission of infectious diseases through droplets and fomite can augment its utility for managing a broad range of infectious diseases. Although in the case of COVID-19, the impact of such improvements will be minor since aerosol is the dominant transmission route of COVID-19. Additionally, while the results of the study provide valuable insights into potential strategies for improving occupational safety, it is important to note that the interventions described in this paper were tested in a single but typical office space. Therefore, their generalizability to other settings may be limited. Further research is necessary to determine how these interventions can be adapted and modified to suit the unique characteristics of different workplaces, such as modeling the infection spread across multiple floors or inside the co-work and hot-desk workspaces, where individuals are not assigned to a permanent location. Additionally, the impact of several random variables on the spread of COVID-19 may be tested in future research, including the location of the initially infected individual and the occupants’ tasks schedule. Implementing the proposed methodology in individual buildings is recommended to identify the most effective interventions for a specific workplace and its unique building layout. This approach enables a more tailored strategy to improve occupational safety that considers the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of each workplace. Future studies could also explore the cost of different interventions in greater detail.

4. Model validation section
In this section, the research methodology and accuracy of CoDiSS are validated by simulating the spread of COVID-19 in a case study of a call center in South Korea and comparing the simulation results to the empirical data. For this purpose, we will simulate the spread of COVID19 in the case study, where the spatial and temporal structure of the office is determined based on the information provided by Park et al. (2020) and the literature. Next, we will compare simulation results for the daily number of infections over – averaged over 100 simulation runs – to the empirical data (Park et al., 2020) to determine the accuracy of CoDiSS in predicting the COVID-19 infection rate in the case study.

Considering that the spread of infectious diseases is highly random, the prediction accuracy achieved by CoDiSS (𝑅𝑀𝑆𝑃 𝐸 = 8%) confirms the behavioral validity of this simulation framework.

In order to validate the effectiveness of CoDiSS, we have successfully conducted two approaches. Firstly, a case study was carried out to assess the model’s ability to generate results that closely align with actual data. The results obtained from this study demonstrated a high degree of similarity between the model’s outputs and the real-world data, indicating the accuracy of CoDiSS. Furthermore, the results obtained from different interventions applied to the framework in Section 5 confirmed that CoDiSS delivers reliable and consistent outcomes across a range of interventions, further highlighting its effectiveness.",Yes,"Given the stochastic behavior of the spread of infectious diseases, these performance indicators are calculated for each intervention for 100 simulation runs – using Monte Carlo simulation – and the average results are reported.

First, we informed the daily probability of sheltering in place with mobility reports from Google (COVID-19 Community Mobility Report, 2021).

Furthermore, we assumed that children were less susceptible to infection than adults, which we modeled with a logistic function calibrated to model-based estimates of this relationship by (Davies et al., 2020). We assumed that severity of disease increased with age, consistent with statistical analyses described elsewhere (Wu et al., 2020; Bi et al., 2020; Lauer et al., 2020; The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020).

This probability was chosen so that, on average, 68 % of agents will self-isolate at some point during their symptoms. This figure of 68 % was based on the proportion of symptomatic infections among healthcare workers in the USA that developed fever during the course of their infection (COVID T.C. et al., 2020), and assuming that those with fever are likely to self-isolate

We assumed that agents did not wear face masks inside their homes, nor did they isolate from their household members if infected.

We modeled protection from face masks by reducing the probability of transmission when an infected agent wore a face mask. Our default assumption followed a median estimate of an adjusted odds ratio of 0.3 against SARS-CoV in non-healthcare settings (Chu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2004).

The proportion of agents wearing face masks in workplace and community settings changed over time, and we assumed that agents did not wear face masks inside their households

To explore how alternative conditions for school reopening could have impacted the statewide burden of COVID-19 in Indiana, we performed simulations that spanned a range of assumptions about school operating capacity and adherence of students and teachers to face masks while in school

Second, we considered the sensitivity of our results to values of two assumed parameters not included in the calibration: protection afforded by face masks and the probability of isolation given symptoms. This included a total of four scenarios exploring lower and higher values of each of those parameters. Third, we considered alternative scenarios about select model assumptions that we regarded as potentially important unknowns about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children.

Whereas we used Google mobility reports to drive a time-varying probability of sheltering in place during that initial period, we opted to assume fixed levels of mobility from August 24 through December 31.

difficult to explain the epidemiological data under that assumption. To overcome that problem and to make this analysis more directly comparable to our other analyses, we held the probability of sheltering in place fixed at either of two levels of mobility during the fall: 1) mobility remained at summer levels, or 2) mobility increased to prepandemic levels. Under these assumptions, we calibrated the two focal parameters about conditions in schools to data from the fall using the same calibration procedure as we used during the initial period

Given our assumption that levels of sheltering in place and face-mask adherence in the community remained constant during the fall (Fig. S2B), this increase in transmission was driven by infections arising in schools (Fig. 3B).

Our sensitivity analysis of assumptions related to the role of children in transmission also focused on cumulative infections statewide in fall 2020. Relative to a baseline with schools operating remotely, the proportional increase in cumulative infections was very similar to our default assumptions under a scenario with lower susceptibility among children aged 0–10 years and a scenario with lower infectiousness of asymptomatic infections (Table S13).

Under an assumption that the probability of sheltering in place in the state as a whole was fixed at levels from summer 2020 (Fig. 6, gray), the model calibration resulted in a median school operating capacity of 0.88 (95 % CrI: 0.8−0.95) and a median face-mask adherence in schools of 0.6 (95 % CrI: 0.4−0.7). Under an assumption that the probability of sheltering in place was fixed at pre-pandemic levels (Fig. 6, red), the model calibration resulted in a median school operating capacity of 0.85 (95 % CrI: 0.77−0.92) and a median face-mask adherence in schools of 0.61 (95 % CrI: 0.41−0.75).

We assume households in a social bubble to be fully connected 4 days out of 7 (i.e., the contact probability between any two bubble members per day is 4/7 = 0.57). We also test a higher and lower level of connectivity in terms of 7/7 and 2/7 days per week, respectively. Social contacts in a household bubble are implemented as a substitute of leisure contacts in the community and can be seen as repetitive leisure contacts with the same individuals. 

In our baseline scenario, we accounted for an increase of B2B mixing (i.e., contacts while at work) from May 4th up to 50% of the pre-pandemic observations. Business-to-consumer (B2C) and leisure transmission is harder to single out using social contact data within our model structure. To model the relaunch of economic activities and other (leisure) activities in the community, we incorporated a limited increase of community mixing up to 30% in our scenario analyses starting from May 25th. Note that we do not claim that the increase of community mixing is estimated to be 30% or restricted to this level, but we provide insights up to 30%.

For schools, we assumed a 50% reduction of transmission due to precautionary measures (smaller class groups, class separation, increased hand hygiene, etc.) and performed sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of these measures. We aligned the baseline scenario with the school regulations and timings for Belgium (see Supplementary Table 7). In addition, we also included more general scenarios for

Our CTS results are based on different assumptions with respect to timing and success rates of tracing, testing, and compliance to home isolation if infected.

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is assumed to be made either via contact tracing and subsequent serial lateral flow antigen (LFA) testing or via symptomatic presentation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

We assumed the use of LFA testing for daily testing for its affordability, detection speed, and ease of use compared to traditional PCR testing (Mina et al., 2020).

Epidemiological assumptions
Table 1 describes the epidemiological assumptions of our simulation.

The detection probability by LFA testing is assumed to depend on the relative infectiousness (Quilty et al., 2021). Although the true detection probability may remain high even after the agent is no longer infectious (Wölfel et al., 2020), this assumption does not significantly alter our results as we are mainly interested in case detection during the infectious phase. The detection probability by PCR testing during the symptomatic phase is assumed to be 100% for simplicity.

Simplicity assumptions

Also, we assume that every symptomatic patient either recovers and becomes immune or dies after 11. 5 days of symptom duration. Furthermore, isolated agents are assumed not to infect others.

Assuming an infection fatality ratio of 1%, 0.8% of the population die in this scenario.

We have assumed that LFA testing was used for serial testing of those who have been identified through contact tracing.

Limitations
There are several limitations to our simulation study. First, we considered a simplified setting with a small population and a two-dimensional space without complex social structures that can lead to super-spreading events. Second, we use the same maximum secondary attack rate of 35% for all infector-infectee contacts, regardless of the duration and nature of the contact.

Third, we assumed all contacts can be traced. The effect of this assumption may be partly offset by lowering the detection probability of LFA testing. Fourth, we did not consider asymptomatic carriers who never develop symptoms.

Furthermore, the number of deaths in our simulation is not a reliable estimate of the mortality for the following reasons. First, age is not considered for the purpose of simplicity. Second, the infection fatality ratio of 1% (World Health Organization, 2020b) is based on the assumption that proper medical care is provided. Our simulation, however, did not take medical care capacity into account. Finally, we assumed that all individuals are perfectly compliant with the isolation policy and that no infection occurs during isolation.",Yes,https://github.com/DSI-COVID-Simulation/code/,Yes,"Silva PCL, Batista PVC, Lima HS, Alves MA, Guimarães FG, Silva RCP.

OpenABM-Covid19 has been used throughout the pandemic by the National Health Service England (NHSE) to model hospital admissions at a regional level in England [18,19].

The epidemic was allowed to grow until 2% of the population had been infected, at which point a lockdown was implemented for 30 days along with a vaccination programme where 2% of adults were inoculated each day (vaccine 90% effective after 15-days).

Lockdown is modelled by reducing the number of interactions that people have on their occupation and random networks (by default by 67%).

Contact reductions can be applied to certain age groups only.

A variable fraction of individuals in each group can be assigned to have a digital contact tracing smartphone app.

S10 Fig demonstrates how digital contact tracing following rapid testing can prevent a second wave even when the average uptake is at only 50% of the total population.

However, since the identification of interactions relies on the index case recalling them, only a fraction of actual interactions are traced.

- Include in the dynamics of the disease the variables linked to the geography and climatology of the area under study. 

- Obtain a set of output variables that allow predicting, at the local level, the occupation of ICU beds by Covid-19 patients and the daily number of patients and deaths by Covid-19.

",Forecasting (Trying to predict the future under current conditions),,Yes,"The model can be used to predict the most likely evolution of the number of cases and hospital bed occupancy in the short term. By adjusting the model to match the data on hospitalizations in intensive care units and deaths due to COVID-19, it is possible to analyze the impact of isolation and social distancing measures on the disease spread dynamics. In addition, it allows for simulating combinations of characteristics that would lead to a potential collapse in the health system due to lack of infrastructure as well as predicting the impact of social events or increases in people’s mobility.

This study presents the complete structure of the model, together with the mathematical and methodological details of its implementation, allowing for appropriate reproducibility.

This observation shows that AbCSim is a reliable tool that can be used as a predictor of ICU bed occupancy in the short term. This information is extremely important for anticipating possible local health care system strain. 

However, the model can be tailored to any city, village or neighborhood, implementing the corresponding GIS layer as described in Appendix C. As already mentioned, in Ref. [40], AbCSim was successfully applied to the city of La Rioja, also in Argentina. In that case, local authorities used it to predict, based on different possible scenarios, the increase in ICU bed occupancy after the end-of-year holidays.

AbCSim provides information that can be used to quantify the effects of implementing different health policies at the local level. These features make this model a useful tool for decision-making with the goal of assessing the use of the health care system and preventing it from collapsing while including a contextualization of people in their local economic and social environment.

However, as the simulation time elapses, a number of agents will have their Aphore_adherence attribute changed. This adaptation means that as time goes by, the values of the number of agents in the different plots linked to leisure, work and recreation have a greater number of agents. 

On the other hand, with each change in the mandatory social distance phase or with each significant change in the mobility of people, the Markov Matrices are updated, which results in an adaptation of the whole system to the changing mobility conditions. ",Stay at home; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Get medical treatment,"The model adequately predicts the daily evolution of people hospitalized in intensive care due to COVID-19. 

These relationships are affected by the average distance in the different places they attend, how long they stay, and the observance of mask use and social distancing rules (Sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2). ",Yes,"This attribute means that β is affected by another coefficient, named mask. This coefficient modulates β when there is close contact, subtracting 30% [25, 33, 57–59] of its value when Ha shows a high level of observant mask use. 

Appendix D presents probabilities in matrices A and B for all age ranges, time slots and neighborhoods defined in AbCSim for the different phases of the Preventive and Mandatory Social Isolation (PMSI) indicated by the Argentine National Government",,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Repast Suite,Yes,ODD,Assumptions; Limitations,"The fraction of individuals requiring hospitalization in intensive care (H) is also considered, and it is assumed that all Ha have the possibility of accessing a respiratory ventilator.

However, if Ha is in a different compartment from Susceptible or Exposed, then they stop moving, since it is assumed that they remains at home to avoid transmitting the disease to other Has.

In other words, the progression of the illness in the host can be defined as a stochastic Markov chain model in which the patient is assumed to always be in one of a finite number of health states (called Markov states).

Ventilation in streets can be considered complete, and thus, the contagion probability in these places is assumed to be practically negligible [62,63]. Therefore, assuming that virus transmission in streets has no impact on the model, it is postulated that mobility on foot from one plot to another is immediate for the Ha.

Vector π is always (1,0,0,0) for the beginning of the day, as it is assumed that all Has start the day at home.

5.Limitations
One of the main limitations is related to obtaining sufficiently detailed official epidemiological data, such as local symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

The methodology of the local health system to obtain the evolution of ICU bed occupancy and deaths was correct. This information allowed the group of researchers to have sufficient data for validation continuously, as soon as the investigation required it, and thus to maintain the model validation. However, the same pattern did not occur with the number of reported daily cases due to the poor testing methodology. Therefore, the number of daily COVID-19 cases (symptomatic and asymptomatic) estimated by the model during the period under analysis is not shown in the Results because in Argentina, official reports are highly dependent on erratic testing policies and insufficient case monitoring, apart from the difficulty in detecting asymptomatic cases.",Yes,https://github.com/Repastero/GeoCOVID-19,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Engineering, Other Non-S&E Fields","Artificial intelligence, Bioengineering and Biomedical Engineering, Other Engineering, Social Work","Laboratorio de Cibernetica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos (UNER), Route Prov. 11, km 10, Ciudad de Oro Verde, provincia de Entre Ríos, Argentina

In this case, by following the methodology presented by other epidemiological models based on agents [9,68], it was verified that the AbCSim outputs are consistent with data collected in the field and that the model output dispersion, measured in terms of the interquartile range, is acceptable.

Since the reported daily case data for this city are compatible with the model outputs, this information can be used as a measure of AbCSim validity, thus defining the values presented in Table 3.

In a complete lockdown, all agents are static, and their movements are completely restricted. However, more generally, not all agents observe lockdown, and some continue to move around, and this is modeled through a lockdown efficacy parameter (κ). Another parameter of a lockdown is the duration, denoted by L. For example, a lockdown with L = 30 and κ = 0.8 implies there is a 30 day lockdown with 20% of agents still mobile, but the other 80% of agents are completely static.",Stay at home; Social distance (6ft); Get medical treatment; General preventative behavior,"The attribute β is included to model hygiene as seen in the real world in the form of protective masks, sanitizers, PPE, etc.

In this experiment, different levels of surge capacity were considered (50% increase, 100% increase in the bed capacity). On day 50, these surge capacities were added to the existing capacity. The purpose of this is to reduce the rate of death on account of inadequate hospital capacity.

Social distancing has been widely used as a policy to slow the spread of disease in many places. There are many interactions between agents in a simulation, and social distancing is said to be followed in such an interaction if the agents are outside the infection ranges of each other. If social distancing is followed in a particular interaction, then there is no disease transmission due to the abovementioned interaction. We define social distancing efficacy (α) as the ratio of the number of interactions where social distancing was followed to the total number of interactions.

If social distancing is followed in this interaction, then agent A is not exposed, and continues to remain in S state even after the interaction.

We also present the the effect of social distancing post-lockdown. In Figure 9, we show the effects of varying levels of social distancing. Social distancing is a much more sensitive parameter compared to hygiene, so a small change in social distancing changes the number

However, the large amount of PCR tests that is required to facilitate this approach, remains an important impediment. Therefore, we propose a new universal testing procedure that is feasible with the current testing capacity, where we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households.

(35 results)

Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our epidemiological model is an abstraction of the real world that relies on a series of assumptions, and therefore the results presented in this manuscript should be interpreted with caution.

An important assumption in this work is the false negative rate of the PCR test, when a pool of samples is processed. We consider a range of false negative values (i.e., 5% and 10%), predominantly informed by the recent work of Yelin et al. [20].

In this work, we do not account for non-household populations explicitly (e.g., undocumented persons, homeless people, or visitors), and we acknowledge that it would be challenging to enrol non-household populations to the universal testing procedure. We argue that, from a modelling point of view, it is reasonable to assume that such populations are part of the non-compliant proportion of society. Furthermore, non-household individuals typically form only a small proportion of the total population [48] and therefore their impact on the general population will be limited. 

Currently, we assume uniform distributions for our model parameters, as specified in Table 2. 

Furthermore, in this study, we assume 70k PCR tests per day for a population of 11 million (50k PCR tests for weekly testing, and 20k PCR tests to test the individuals in the positive pools), which implies that every day a number of tests is available that corresponds to 0.68% of the population. This number of tests is a reasonable assumption, to which many countries anticipated for the autumn and winter of 2020 [22, 24].

Limitations (implied)

While the work by Yelin et al. is valuable to inform our models [20], we argue that in order to implement pool-based testing on a large scale, a population-based evaluation of the sensitivity of pooled PCR testing is warranted.

To assess policies in a realistic framework, it is essential to consider difficulties and issues in the implementation of the intervention strategy, as they will be inevitable if the policy is to be implemented. This includes technical properties of the tests, as mentioned above, but also the willingness of individuals to participate. 

universal testing is logistically challenging, but once these logistics are in place, the process is transparent. An important consideration with respect to universal testing is compliance fatigue and this is an aspect that should be closely monitored. We note that this can be monitored, as the failure rate with respect to testing compliance is a by-product of the universal testing procedure.

Furthermore, non-household individuals typically form only a small proportion of the total population [48] and therefore their impact on the general population will be limited. However, given the fact that this population is highly compartmentalized [49], and constitutes a fragile segment of the population, a specialized program is warranted to avoid outbreaks in this sub-population.

One point of concern is that recently recovered individuals could still carry virus particles and render a PCR test positive. While this is not a problem when individual isolation is used, as these individuals can be excluded from the future pool, this could result in false positives when pool isolation is used. While we argue that this artefact is less likely to occur due to sample dilution [20], this warrants further investigation. 

Currently, we assume uniform distributions for our model parameters, as specified in Table 2. While these distributions are a conservative assumption, as the uniform distribution maximizes entropy over a specified interval, we note that the use of a log-normal or gamma distribution for the incubation period would be interesting to investigate for future work [31, 34]. Uniform distributions induce an increase in transmissibility during the pre-symptomatic phase, possibly reducing the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, as by the time a case is detected it might have already generated a new infection. While this will not have an important effect on the qualitative results of the study, it might alter the quantitative results.

Finally, we note that this study was conducted in the context of the Belgian SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, and the reader should be careful to extrapolate these findings to other epidemic contexts. Nevertheless, when the population structure (e.g., household distribution) and size are similar, we believe that the methods presented in this work can be applied to administrative regions of different countries.",Yes,"For archival purposes, we added a

Agents who tested positive can be treated at home, through routine hospitalization, or in ICUs, depending on the severity of the disease, which is determined in a stochastic fashion, consistent with COVID-19 clinical data [61].

Similar to our previous work [42], the model contemplates vaccination for agents. In our simulations, we mimic a continuously progressing vaccination campaign.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
Consistent with the premise of lack of hospitalization, we assumed that none of the virtual bed capacity of Colonie was allocated to patients with conditions other than COVID-19.

Tests are performed in hospitals or in independent testing sites, where the latter locations are assumed to pose no risk of transmission.

Once vaccinated, we assume that individuals are granted full immunity to COVID-19. Despite being simplistic, such an assumption should be realistic for the short-term simulation window (through Summer 2021) considered in this work.

All cities are assumed to have the same risk levels from travels from and to neighboring cities, transmission in public transit, and frequency of visiting non-essential business locations.

In the first analysis, we selectively excluded different location types from the spread by assuming that no transmission can happen in that type of locations (technically, by setting the corresponding transmission rate to 0).

Under the assumption of perfect immunity, results in Fig. 5confirm that vaccination of healthcare employees greatly reduces the toll of the epidemic.

While we have assumed that vaccines grant full, long-lasting immunity, it is tenable that equivalent, albeit reduced, benefits would persist under more realistic conditions, in line with other studies [67,68].

Limitations
When interpreting the results of our work, one should keep in mind several of its limitations. First, our testing and detection procedure is very conservative, with agents isolating as soon as they decide to get tested. This is likely a more optimistic scenario than what is encountered in reality, especially after relaxing local quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated [83]. Second, the model does not accommodate any form of contact tracing, which is still a major component of COVID-19 curbing. Third, the vaccines are also assumed to act in an idealized fashion, and there are no limits to their application, like agents’ age or hesitancy. Fourth, our model does not account for additional deaths that may result from the overburden of hospitals and the reduction of hospital employees due to infection. Adding such features may partly reduce differences in the number of deaths between the three cities.

339,Zachreson 2021,How will mass-vaccination change COVID-19 lockdown requirements in Australia?,Consensus,Yes,"In this work, we approach these questions with a large-scale agent-based model (ABM) of COVID-19 transmission, case-targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions, lockdowns, and mass-vaccination in the context of Australia, using the latest available information.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",No,,Yes,Australia,Considered and imposed,"This is addressed by varying vaccination coverage with different vaccine efficacy combinations.

For example, social distancing compliance can be set at 80% at the macro-level, while micro-distancing contacts during a lockdown can be reduced to 10% within workplaces and 25% within communities (cf. Table S3).

In our hybrid mass-vaccination scenarios, we assume at least 5 × 106 priority immunisations, so the entire population over the age of 64 years is immunised with the priority vaccine, while the remaining immunisations are distributed between children and adults under 65 in a ratio of 10/1 (adults/children). All immunisations are allocated on day 0 of each outbreak simulation. Note that because our allocation procedure terminates after all individuals aged 18 or older are immunised, the maximum number of vaccinated children is 1/10 of the population between 18 and 64, or 1.4M children vaccinated. This accounts for approximately 25% of the population under 18, reflecting the tighter regulations on vaccine approval for these age groups worldwide, which are currently relaxing for adolescents over the age of 12. Therefore, the maximum number of immunisations is capped at 19.3M, leaving approximately 4.2M children unvaccinated.

To improve the realism of our model for simulating hybrid vaccination scenarios, we use the latest estimates of coverage with the priority vaccine (enough has been purchased at the time of writing to vaccinate up to 10M individuals, or approximately 40% of the population), and the general vaccine. We assume that the general vaccine will not be subject to supply constraints, with coverage limited instead by uptake.

We compare scenarios ranging from a relatively small number of priority vaccine immunisations (5M two-dose vaccinations), to an optimistic endpoint scenario with 10M priority (two-dose) immunisations and an additional 9.3M general immunisations, for coverage of 82% (100% of the adult population, and 25% of the population aged less than 18 years).",Stay at home; Get vaccinated,"In our mass-vaccination scenarios, we used an age-stratified vaccine allocation scheme. Starting with no individuals vaccinated,
the algorithm allocates new immunisations randomly according to the following ratio: 100:10:1, which correspond to [age ≥ 65] :

In this system, individuals aged 65 and older are preferentially vaccinated, with second preference for those aged 18 - 64 years, and third preference for those under the
age of 18 (see Methods).

To improve the realism of our model for simulating hybrid vaccination scenarios, we use the latest estimates of coverage with the priority vaccine (enough has been purchased at the time of writing to vaccinate up to 10M individuals, or approximately 40% of the population), and the general vaccine. ",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume) 
That assumption was modified in this work, for which pre-symptomatic cases are assumed to be as infectious as symptomatic cases (with respect to viral load), while those who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of disease have reduced infectivity (a factor of 0.5 is applied to the force of infection exerted on contacts).

In our hybrid mass-vaccination scenarios, we assume at least 5 × 106 priority immunisations, so the entire population over the age of 64 years is immunised with the priority vaccine, while the remaining immunisations are distributed between children and adults under 65 in a ratio of 10/1 (adults/children).

Assuming limited vaccination in the Australian population younger than 18, overall vaccination coverage is constrained to less than 80%, even if the entire adult population is vaccinated.

We assume that the general vaccine will not be subject to supply constraints, with coverage limited instead by uptake.

In our model of COVID-19 transmission, we did not truncate the susceptibility or infectiousness of children but we did assume a lower rate of symptom expression, in line with the available evidence [1].

Limitations, caveat
Limitations and future work section
Nevertheless, the model does not explicitly capture in-hotel quarantine, hospitalisations, and in-hospital transmissions. This limitation is offset by the fact that in Australia’s vaccination plan, healthcare and border control professionals are included in the priority vaccination phase, carried out in a pre-pandemic mode. We also do not systematically quantify mortality rates, and do not elaborate on the expanding disease surveillance capacity and standard clinical pathways in Australia [34].


Another caveat is that our ABM population is matched to the latest Australian Census data, which was collected in 2016.

Finally, our simulations treat the entire population as initially susceptible, not accounting for the influence of pre-existing immunity in the population produced by previous waves of COVID-19 in Australia. The effective suppression of these previous outbreaks has kept cumulative confirmed case totals below 1% of the total population, so we do not expect this simplifying assumption to influence our results.",No,,Yes,"Chang SL, Harding N, Zachreson C, Cliff OM, Prokopenko M.

Furthermore, the model is calibrated to key COVID-19 characteristics, using age-dependent contact and transmission rates (scaled to match the COVID-19 reproductive number R0 by the scaling factor κ), the fraction of symptomatic cases (set as 0.134 for children, and 0.669 for adults), the probabilities of transmission for asymptomatic/presymptomatic and symptomatic agents, and other parameters specifying the natural disease history model (see below) [1].

• Infectious incubation times (Tinc) calibrated to the findings of Lauer et al. [11] who inferred log-normally distributed incubation times with mean 5.5 days.

This change reflects the general finding that pre-symptomatic transmission is responsible for a substantial amount of COVID-19 spread (up to 50% of transmission), and allows a parsimonious calibration of disease natural history, reproductive ratio, and generation interval [14,15].

Model calibration section
Because the models of disease natural history and case ascertainment were modified, we re-calibrated the model used by Chang et al. [1] to approximately match the case incidence data recorded during the first and second waves of COVID19 in Australia and the global reproduction number of R0 ≈ 2.9 95% CI [2.39, 3.44] [16] (see Supplementary Material).

Our study uses a fine-grained computational simulation of over 23 million agents generated to match census-based demographics of Australia, calibrated to reproduce key epidemiological features of the COVID-19 pandemic, and successfully validated in our previous studies.

In order to capture population heterogeneity, we adapted a previously developed and validated high-resolution ABM of mitigation and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia [1,7].

A typical distribution of local transmissions (distinct from overseas acquired cases), traced from the simulation, has been cross-validated with the genomic surveillance data in Australia [7].

In the Supplementary Material, we show results obtained for higher general vaccine efficacy (raised from VEc = 0.6 to VEc = 0.75, Fig. S7a), demonstrating that this approximate threshold was not sensitive within this range to the precise efficacy value used for the general vaccine. In addition, we carried out sensitivity analysis in terms of efficacy against infectiousness for the priority vaccine, contrasting higher (VEi = 0.684) and lower levels (VEi = 0.5).

Finally, we examined the sensitivity of our results to the priority structure of vaccine rollout (Figures S7b and S7c).

This result reflects a low sensitivity of the model to priority levels when overall vaccination coverage remains unchanged.

In order to verify robustness of our results to changes in VEi between higher and lower levels, we carried out an additional sensitivity analysis which confirmed that the reported outcomes persist across this range of VEi values (Fig. S7).

The optimistic setting for general vaccine (VEc = 0.75) was also used in sensitivity analysis of (a) the effects of changing infectiousness efficacy for the priority vaccine from a higher (VEi = 0.684) to a lower level (VEi = 0.5), for the original allocation ratio 10 0:10:1 (cf. Figures S7a and S7b), and (b) the impact of the adjusted rollout strategy based on the revised allocation ratios, while maintaining the more conservative level of efficacy against infectiousness (VEi = 0.5) for the priority vaccine (cf.

As demonstrated in our previous studies [13, 15, 26], these components can be included within an ABM study but substantially increase its scope. Our simulations ran over a period of 196 days, without considering re-infections. Given the considered simulation horizon, this limitation has a minor effect discussed in our study of recurrent waves [15]. Our focus on the three dominant variants of concern rather than on their numerous sub-lineages (which may co-circulate) allowed us to distill some of the salient public health lessons. We believe these lessons would remain relevant across other sub-variants, including co-circulating ones. We re-iterate that our aim was to compare key pandemic scenarios rather than replicate the 2021 incidence of COVID-19 in Australia. Thus, we intentionally did not use the air traffic data between 2020 to 2021 due to the severe disruption of international travel caused by the travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic at the time. Our ABM includes a substantial number of parameters, which have been calibrated to different variants or estimated using available epidemiological evidence. As more data become available, the parameter ranges may change and some estimates and findings may be refined. At the same time, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis provides strong evidence that the model and its outcomes are robust to parameter changes. Finally, we did not model the differences in vaccine efficacy across variants of concern (including ancestral, Delta, and Omicron variants). This should not impact the outcomes over the considered simulation horizon. Nevertheless, our model will be extended in near future, addressing these limitations (re-infections and multiple co-circulating variants with different immunity profiles).

In simulating pandemic scenarios, we assumed a moderate level of preemptive vaccination coverage of the population (50%), accounting for the combined effects of a relatively high vaccination coverage in Australia [27] and low diminishing vaccine efficacy

We assume that SA2 areas are spatially distributed and the geographic distance between any pair of SA2 areas is calculated as the distance between the centroids of two SA2 areas defined by the ABS-provided shapefiles representing geographical boundaries

The allocation of schools is based on the following assumptions. The probability of students attending a school is set in proportion to the geographic distance between the school and their residence, within the school’s catchment zone. This process emulates the tendency of students to initially prioritize schools in the closest proximity. If schools nearby are unavailable, students are assumed to expand their search to nearby options within the maximum travel distance (150 km). This ensures that the vast majority of students are assigned to schools by the end of the generation process.

The disease natural history for COVID-19 was assumed to be as follows: the latent period is drawn from an approximately Gaussian distribution between 1 and 7 days (mean 3.75), with the incubation period lasting one additional day (i.e., between 2 and 8 days). The infectious period is drawn from a similar distribution between 3 and 9 days (mean 5.6).

Although some of these percentages were chosen based on discussions with subject matter experts from the State of New Mexico, similar reductions were observed in other areas.

This is necessary because our community model assumes that elementary and secondary school children attend school in the tract/community in which they reside, not accounting for bussing across Census tract boundaries which the actual employment statistics reflect.

For the added mixing, from students to teachers/staff and vice versa, we assume that the individual child-adult contacts are twice the child-child contact rates.

In order to simulate COVID-19 transmission within a community, we used parameter assumptions and model-produced epidemiological data from the CDC’s Pandemic Planning Scenarios released in May 2020

Furthermore, the proportion of infections which remain asymptomatic are assumed to be 40% and the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals is assumed to be 75%. Self-isolation of symptomatic individuals is assumed to be similar to those used for pandemic influenza studies. (CDC, 2020) We assumed levels of reduction in contacts to quantify the impact of social distancing, facemasks, and hygiene (Table 2).

thus assume that the simulation starts on August 15, 2020. Assumptions regarding full time, part-time, the number of individuals teleworking, and employees laid off as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are shown in Table 2. 

The model assumptions on working in the workplace versus working from home or being laid off were based on the values in both

These two scenarios describe different levels of in-person workplace assumptions (Table 2, and Figure A-1 and Table B-1 in the appendix)

More Open Workplaces assumes staffing of additional worksites with an expanded number of onsite workers

For a comparison across intervention approaches, we also use a Pre-pandemic Behavior scenario, which assumes that all businesses are open with no capacity or social distancing restrictions.

For the regional model, we assume that the 2020–2021 school year for the Chicago Public Schools begins on September 8th, 2020. The national scale model assumes different start dates for the 2020–2021 school year ranging from August 3rd, 2020 (Arizona) to September 16th, 2020 (New York) based on publicly available information from school districts. We assume a 50% reduction in contacts due to social distancing measures implemented at school settings for the Fewer Open Workplaces and a 25% reduction for the More Open Workplaces (Table 2).

These hybrid scenarios assume appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and wearing facemasks at school.

Table 2 Workforce status & reduction in contacts due to social distancing assumptions

Table 4 Summary of key EpiCast results for the Nation – Part 1.
Our findings should be considered in context of several potential limitations. First, the model assumed the same level of workplace restrictions (namely Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open Workplaces) uniformly across all the states in the U.S. in order to compare the different scenarios under similar conditions. However, there is evidence that each state has implemented different public health actions resulting in drastically distinct operating statuses for businesses that have reopened. (National Governors Association (NGA), 2020) Therefore, incorporating the heterogeneity in state actions may be necessary in order to better quantify the impact of school reopening scenarios on COVID-19 spread. Second, we did not consider testing and contact tracing explicitly in the simulation. Although we assume isolation of symptomatic individuals promptly after symptom onset, we know that effective contact tracing and testing, in combination with hybrid school reopen ing scenarios and social distancing measures, will be critical for safely reopening schools. Third, we projected epidemic trajectories through the beginning of April 2021 in order to assess the potential impact of school reopening scenarios during the autumn and winter months. However, several studies (Moran and Del Valle, 2016) have shown that behavioral responses to an epidemic or pandemic are highly dependent on the perception of the severity of the disease. Thus, we expect the behavior and compliance to change and fluctuate in the next six months as a result of new public health orders and disease perception; however, we do not have adequate data to predict this, and therefore assume that the same level of restriction and compliance to non-pharmaceutical interventions will remain in place. Specifically, we assumed 50% reduction in social contacts due to social distancing and facemask measures for the Fewer Workplaces Open scenario and 25% for the More Workplaces Open scenario. These assumptions are likely to be higher in school settings where teachers and staff may enforce face coverings and social distancing measures. Fourth, the population distribution in EpiCast is based upon the 2000 U.S. Census data to take advantage of available tract-to-tract work flow data. This is a major limitation for areas that have seen significant population changes in the last two de cades. For example, as Table 4B in the Appendix shows, there has been a significant population increase in the age group of over 55 (i.e., 37.3 million increases in 2019 compared to 2000, which accounts for 80% of total population increase). Therefore, the simulation may be conservative in terms of the potential contacts and spread, as well as the projected hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. Also, the epidemiological parameters have spatial and temporal variability during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional studies are needed in order to quantify the impact of changing these assumptions on the epidemic projections. Fifth, the study did not assume the use or uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. However, the results are still relevant for the 2020 fall school season when vaccines were not available anywhere, as well as presently for any settings where they still may not be widely available. Sixth, our results were not overly sensitive to the assumptions about students to teachers/staff and vice versa, and we note that the numbers of child-child transmissions are still greater than child-adult transmission due to the much larger number of children in a school. Finally, this study took place during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and did not account for the shifts we’ve observed for other variants such as targeting younger populations. While there is uncertainty in our epidemic projections, our results are consistent with previously published studies (Germann et al., 2019; Courtemanche et al., 2020; Korevaar et al., 2020; Brauner et al., 2020) and are intended to serve as guidance for decision regarding the impacts of different school reopening scenarios in the U.S. Specifically, recent studies have evaluated the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (Haug et al., 2020; Banholzer et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) and have found that a balanced approach that reduces risk while enabling limited business activity and education can be achieved through careful implementations of non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, we note that the benefits and limitations of scenario analysis will not play out exactly as specified in this study due to heterogeneities in interventions and compliance",No,https://github.com/lanl/covid19-school-reopening-study,Yes,EpiCast,One discipline,Industry,,"Physics & Chemistry of Materials, Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA

We assume a wholly susceptible, unvaccinated population as the COVID-19 vaccine uptake rate in remote communities has so far been low [11].

The full detail of the model is provided in the Additional file  1: Appendix S1, with the key features and assumptions for this analysis highlighted in the following sections.

Population assumptions section

Epidemic assumptions section

We assume infectiousness commences 48  h prior to symptom onset on average [15] and ceases with symptom resolution.

The basic reproduction number R0 was calibrated, through adjustment to transmission probability per contact, to centre around 5, based on similar contexts [16–18] and allowing for enhanced mixing anticipated in overcrowded households [19–21] (Sect. 2 of the Additional file 1: Appendix S1; the results for additional analyses conducted under the assumption of smaller values for R0 of 2 and 3 are contained in Sect. 7.4 of the Additional file 1: Appendix S1). We conservatively assume that only 50% of infected patients will self-present for testing, due either to minimal/no/unrecognised symptoms, fear/anxiety, or stigma.

Intervention assumptions section
Cases (those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2) are assumed to be isolated immediately and effectively. Contacts of cases, as variously defined below, are quarantined alone and assumed to be completely separated from others.

Case isolation and quarantine Apart from the ‘No response’ scenario, we assume each identified case of positive SARS-CoV-2 infection will be immediately placed in isolation for 10  days in accordance with National guidelines [22].

We assume both isolation and quarantine are ideal, and that an individual cannot transmit or be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while in isolation or quarantine.

We assume a 2-day delay between a test being conducted and initiation of the public health response. We also assume 100% test sensitivity.

• Clearance testing prior to release from quarantine for all contacts (on day 12 of 14, assuming a 2-day delay between the test being conducted and diagnosis becoming available); • Clearance testing prior to release from isolation for all cases (on day 8 of 10, assuming a 2-day delay between the test being conducted and diagnosis becoming available)

We assume lockdown is triggered at the first diagnosis of COVID-19 in the population.

For our analyses, we assume a scenario in which an initial case enters the community while pre-symptomatic and is detected only on subsequent self-presentation and testing.

Entry testing is assumed to occur for all these scenarios.

We assume only half of all infected patients will self-present to health services for testing, due to absent, unrecognised or minimal symptoms, fear, or stigma.

Higher non-presenting proportions would lead to poorer mitigation in all scenarios, while interventions will have greater impact if this proportion is higher than assumed here (see Additional file  1: Appendix S1).

Limitations section
In developing our model, simplifying assumptions due to limited observational data regarding population structure and mixing were necessary.

Assumptions regarding transmission dynamics are derived from non-Aboriginal populations, but where possible we have erred on the side of caution.

It is therefore entirely possible that our assumed R0 of 5 for remote communities is close to or even underestimates the real R0 should the Delta variant reach these communities. We also assume perfect sensitivity and specificity of testing throughout the infectious period.

We assume that cases in isolation and contacts in quarantine will have no contact with others (i.e., will not transmit SARS-CoV-2). This may not be possible to achieve for every remote communities, but this assumption was based on stakeholder input from the Northern Territory, Australia, where suitable facilities have been made available for use to many communities by the resources sector.

We also assume a wholly susceptible, unvaccinated population, as less than 5% of the total Australian population was fully vaccinated as of mid-2021[32], with this proportion likely to be lower in remote communities [11].",Yes,https://github.com/The-Kirby-Institute,Yes,"An individual-based model, repurposed from a framework developed to examine dynamics of sexually transmitted infections in remote Australia, is used to explicitly represent each community member [12].

This group liaises with peak national health advisory bodies on COVID-19 and commissioned the work that we present here to help inform optimal public health response strategies in remote settings.

A participatory approach was employed throughout this study. All SARS-CoV-2 outbreak response scenarios explored were designed through iterative engagement between the academic investigators, the IAG, and other public health end-users to ensure cultural sensitivity, and to maximise the relevance and uptake of findings.

While this is an ambitious target given the lockdown compliance rate has been observed to be closer to 50–60% in Australian cities [24], our consultation with stakeholders suggested that a higher compliance rate is possible for remote communities due to smaller population size and physical isolation. 

The participatory process employed between this study’s investigators, the IAG, and other public health end-users throughout, has allowed for direct feedback of our findings and incorporation into IAG guidelines [9], and collaborative development of plain-language messaging for health providers and community members.

Text:
Once exposed, agents follow a SEIR probabilistic disease progression (Tec et al. 2020), which also e!ects their behavior. For example, symptomatic agents curtail all three activities regardless of risk tolerance.

Agents within the same social network do not necessarily ever come into contact contacts are realized dynamically based on decisions driven by risk tolerance. Risk tolerance, which describes an agent’s willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not wearing a mask, attending large gatherings), is initialized as a monotonically decreasing function of age. This approach is consistent both with media reports of younger people ignoring COVID-19 public-health warnings and with biological evidence that risk taking behavior decreases monotonically with age (Rutledge et al. 2016). From a policy perspective, a shelter-in-place (SIP) measure is the most interesting lever modulating the agents’ environment as it controls the designation of essential and nonessential activities and occupations.

When the SIP order is active, only workers with occupations defined by the policy as “essential” continue these interactions. While much of the modeled population reduces contacts, essential workers unintentionally end up playing a central role in disease spread as they continue interacting with the individuals receiving essential services. Social events are nonessential activities discouraged during SIP. These are considered risky activities, and agents with higher risk tolerance are likely to flout SIP and continue to engage in the social sphere

Agents modify their behavior– based on observations of the infection status and behavior of their peers through two types of updates. Network updates cause agents to revise their risk tolerance based on the prevalence of the disease in their social network. This introduces both so-called “contagions of fear” (Epstein et al. 2008) and also over confidence in the absence of caution. Event updates impact the risk tolerance of participants within a single interaction by moving the risk tolerance of all participating agents towards the group mean. This simulates the influence of social reinforcement or erosion of behaviors, for example, mask wearing. Planned interactions may or may not occur based on risk tolerance-driven decision making. For example, an agent with a large social network but a low risk tolerance, may cancel all social activities and not come into contact with anyone in their social network.

Fig 6a–6c depict the relationship between the cumulative numbers of quarantined and infected individuals under the assumption that the probability of registration, apps’ perception rate, which is defined as the probability that the apps detect positive contacts, and probability of self-quarantining upon receiving the alert are varied between 0% to 100%, respectively. The daily tests are conducted on randomly selected symptomatic people with a probability of 50%, and the download rate is set to 90%.

The daily tests are assumed to be conducted on randomly selected symptomatic people with a probability of 50%, and the download rate is set to 90%. When social distancing is applied, 75% or 51% of the contacts that are randomly selected in the community and service-industry layers are negated, while their contacts in the home, workplace, school, and nursing home are maintained: Roughly, negating 75% and 51% of contacts correspond to the scenarios in which each person decreases their time outside the home by 50% or 30%, respectively, apart from commuting.

When contact-tracing apps are introduced, a certain fraction of people between 15 and 70 years old download the apps in the initial period: The reported usage rate for smartphones differs across age groups, with a relatively small fraction of people below 15 and over 70 years old having one [15]. For simplicity, the model assumes that only those between the ages 15 and 70, who account for 65.8% of the total population, have smartphones. Moreover, the term download rate denotes the ratio of the number of app users to the number of smartphone users.

The model assumes two types of response to the app notification: the notified individuals quarantine themselves (type-Q response) or they get tested (type-T response).

This is followed by daily transmission of the virus through contacts, assuming that the community and service-industry contacts are shuffled every day.

The setting in which they meet (referred to as a layer) is assumed to be one of the determinants of the probability of transmission because the frequency and duration of the meeting depends on the type of contact.

Thus, the probability that an infected person transmits the virus to their contacts in the family layer is assumed to be higher than that in the other layers.

Thus, the model assumes that the true number of the infected in each age group is three-fold that of the reported cases.

Thus, it is assumed that they have no outside contacts, with contacts at their homes and nursing homes decreasing by 20% from the levels in normal times.

For simplicity, the model assumes that only those between the ages 15 and 70, who account for 65.8% of the total population, have smartphones.

It is assumed that it takes a day for tested people to receive their results, since the reported lag is one day in many cases, with some cases of two or three days in Japan [16].

In contrast to isolation, people in quarantine are assumed to reduce their daily contact with people outside their homes by 90%, while their contact with their family members, or with those in nursing homes depending on the case, would be as per usual.

In these two scenarios, people are assumed to either quarantine or get tested depending on the response type.

In addition, the apps in the model are assumed to register all contacts in the past seven days, without any error. These strong assumptions do not hold in reality.

Therefore, for the analysis, a randomly selected 60% of school-age children are assumed to attend kindergartens or nurseries.

People in this society are assumed to have contacts through the networks in six places (see Table 4): Family networks are automatically formed when family members are created.

Each scenario assumes that a randomly selected person becomes infected on February 14, when the actual first positive individual was confirmed in Japan.

Tests and apps are assumed to start on day 33, and are assumed to be in place until the final day in the simulations.

To identify the main driver, counterfactual experiments were conducted, assuming two hypothetical scenarios (Table 5). In one scenario, TC1, 100% sensitivity of the tests conducted for the alerted app users is assumed.

Thus, the assumption in the main analysis that all app users will register test results and quarantine themselves when they receive an alert can be considered optimistic. Fig 6a–6c depict the relationship between the cumulative numbers of quarantined and infected individuals under the assumption that the probability of registration, apps’ perception rate, which is defined as the probability that the apps detect positive contacts, and probability of self-quarantining upon receiving the alert are varied between 0% to 100%, respectively.

Thus far, the analysis assumes the simplest scenario in which interventions other than testing and apps are not implemented and only preexisting variants are transmitted.

This section discusses how the type-Q response’s superiority to the type-T response changes when these assumptions are considered.

The daily tests are assumed to be conducted on randomly selected symptomatic people with a probability of 50%, and the download rate is set to 90%.

Vaccines are assumed to be given to 0.7% of the population every day, with those aged over 65 years prioritized [26].

Once COVID-19 breaks out, this area will be sealed off and isolated. Therefore, in our model, we assume Huangpu District is isolated.

The other test is to become a close contact (an agent that is already in home quarantine) and wait for a doctor to come in for a test, which we assume is less of a risk of infection. We assume that an agent in a susceptible state will undergo a nucleic acid test some time after the decision to do so (fixation), and the test results will appear some time after the test (fixation).

We assume that the population of agents with influenza is constant, that they will increase the burden of the detection site, and that they will also become infected if they come into contact with an infected person when they are tested.

shortcoming
Of course, the shortcomings of the agent model are also prominent. Its computation cost is relatively high, especially when residents maintain a social distance of 1 m in public places under scenario simulation, which results in a long computation time of the model.

However, there are still some shortcomings in the model. Due to the lack of real crowd movement data in our model, we adopted the Haversine formula in crowd movement. Although we added bus, subway, private car travel and other travel modes, there are still shortcomings in the mobility of agents and random contact of crowds. Model does not include the whole community for nucleic acid detection, while the agent model is going to hospital for nucleic acid detection, doctor visits, and allowed to have similar symptoms of agent for nucleic acid detection, but for the entire community as a whole for nucleic acid detection also shortcomings, these deficiencies can lead to model running late for detection of COVID-19 cases.",No,,Yes,"This model is based on the early agent model used by Ferguson et al.

This algorithm accommodates short- and long-range movements of agents within a bounded region (assumed to be square in shape in this work, without any major loss in generality) while avoiding collisions.

In this work, we assume that motion, as governed by a modified Boids algorithm [95], provides for the same.

Therefore, in our model, we assume that an uninfected agent may contract the disease from an infected agent by virtue of their physical proximity. Each agent is associated with an infection radius (rI) and is assumed to interact with those within this bound. The interactions are assumed to be sufficiently long to facilitate the spread.

In this work, we have assumed that there is no exposed period, that is, the time between coming in contact with an infected individual and becoming infectious. Consequently, when an asymptomatic and uninfected individual contracts the disease, we assume that it will initially be asymptomatic.

Although we assume that the probability of contracting the disease (Pg I) is invariant of the initial state of an uninfected agent, it may depend on age

Accordingly, when an uninfected agent comes in contact with an infected agent, the probability of contracting the disease is assumed to be the lowest when the uninfected agent is young and the highest when old.

We have assumed that symptomatic agents are more likely to get tested than the agents who are asymptomatic.

Also, we assume that the infected and tested agents will have better medical attention than those unaware of the infection.

We make the following assumptions regarding the transition probabilities. a) An infected (AIN, AIT) senior citizen is most likely to develop a severe illness, while children are least likely to show symptoms b) An AIT agent is assumed to have access to better medical attention than those not tested (AIN) and, consequently, is less likely to develop symptoms c) Among the infected agents, children are least likely to succumb to the infection d) Infected agents who are symptomatic have a higher chance of succumbing to the disease than those who are asymptomatic e) An infected and tested agent is less likely to succumb to the disease due to medical intervention in comparison with those nottested 

We assume that an infected agent who is symptomatic has a lower chance of recovery than the one who is asymptomatic

We assume that an agent who recovers from the disease is immune to reinfections.

As discussed in Section II, we have assumed that the agents exhibit one of the three motion patterns: stay-at-home and short- and long-range movements.

In this work, we assume that the entire population is vaccinated, but only a fraction of the agents are successfully immunized.

With tests, it can also be assumed that an infected agent has better access to medical care.

We assume a region within the bounded region where the infections are concentrated, called the containment zone (see Fig. 4).

We have also assumed that, initially, 1% of the total population is infected and not tested.

Since the average recovery time of COVID has been observed to be 14 days [101], we assume that the entire life-cycle of the disease—infection, testing, disease progression, and recovery—can be demonstrated during 21 days.

All agents are assumed to remain stationary.

Since the disease is assumed to be transmitted by virtue of the physical proximity of agents, initial positions that are well spread yield lower infections than when a group of agents is clustered.

To account for a realistic representation of mobility patterns, in the experiments evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions, we have assumed that 70% of children, 80% of adults, and 65% of seniors display long-range movement due to the nature of their activities.

The assumption of access to the medical care of the tested and infected individuals has shown a significant reduction in deaths in comparison with scenarios with only social distancing or vaccination.

Assuming that infected and tested individuals will have access to better medical care reflects in reduced fatalities.

However, the proposed model makes simplifying assumptions regarding human motion patterns, which may not be realistic.

To address the issue of ACCs, this paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory for COVID-19 (STEM-COVID) to identify ACCs from contact tracing data.
Fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks (see Sect. 5.1), as a class of biologically-inspired self-organized neural networks, are an effective computational tool to encode and recall episodic memory [22–24]. For efficient memory encoding and ACCs search, we have extended one such model called Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory (STEM) [24] to encode the collective spatiotemporal traces and the COVID-19 positivity of tested individuals [25].

The Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is a neural network architecture used to emulate how brains process information for pattern recognition and prediction, given bottom-up sensory information and top-down expectation [54, 55]. As shown in Fig. 5, fusion ART is a form of multi-channel ART which encodes multimodal input patterns as cognitive nodes (marked as ellipses) in the top F2 layer and enables recognition and recall of stored patterns through the connections (marked as black semicircles) between the F1 and F2 layers [56–59].",Yes,"(1) The first group consists of symptomatic COVID-19 patients who have been diagnosed positive with the virus and are isolated after the onset of symptoms.

Since we assume that SCCs will be identified and isolated once they show any symptom, their contagiousness after the symptom onset will not be considered in the simulation.",No,,No,,Yes,"Let Fi(i > 1) be one category field, where the learned cognitive nodes are stored.

Let y = (y1, y2, …, ym) be the activity vector of F2, formed from the activation values of the cognitive nodes, where m is the number of currently learned categories.

Weight vectors: Let wk j be the weight vector associated with the jth node in F2 for learning the input patterns of Fk 1. Parameters: The dynamics of each input field k is determined by its choice parameter ak >= 0, learning rate bk, contribution parameter ck and vigilance qk, where bk; ck; qk [0; 1].

For each channel k, the weight vector wk J is modified by the learning rule given in Eq. (4).

The weights of a newly committed node J are initialized by an overwriting learning as wk = xk; 1 =< k =< n. In turn, the learned pattern in a selected node J in F2 may perform an Activity Readout to all corresponding Fk 1 fields by xknew = wk J as the output.

Learning episodic memory to identify ACCs, as the task in this paper, requires explicitly encoding the spatiotemporal contextual information of events as in STEM.

Second, besides generalizing the input patterns of single events as performed in STEM, the new memory model in this paper needs to learn the episodic trace of each individual, which consists of patterns of multiple different events.

This learning scheme bears some similarity with that in EM-ART that represents an episode as a cognitive node in its F3 layer.

After the events on the episodic trace of an individual are presented and learned by the bottom network, the episodic trace is represented by the activity vector y of the event field, denoted as e here for clarity.

In the next step, the vectors e and c are used as the activity vectors of the two input fields for the top network, which learns a unique code for each individual in the F3 layer. In general, the event field and F3 layer (i.e., the two category fields of the bottom and top network) continuously grow in response to novel patterns of events and individuals.

A standard learning process in fusion ART networks will then involve code activation and resonance search whereby nodes in the F2 layer are visited through some iterations of code competition and template matching.

Therefore, the learning in the top network also avoids invoking iterations of bottom-up activation and top-down matching to seek resonance.

320,Pr 2020,Effects of misinformation diffusion during a pandemic,Consensus,Yes,"In this paper, we are specifically interested in the spread of misinformation resulting from scepticism towards policies and proper behaviour guidance by governments. Assessing the role of misinformation diffusion is crucial for its impact on policies aimed at limiting the circulation of the virus, for example by imposing the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), distancing measures and lockdown strategies.

This kind of news can influence citizens and lead them to act in irresponsible and harming ways for themselves and others. Our aim in this study is to define and quantify such impact.

A counterpart of this research, offered in our paper, is an analysis of the effect of misinformation diffusion on the spread of a pandemic through an agent-based model and simulation. Specifically, we studied the process of information transmission in the presence of malicious agents spreading potentially false information by rejecting the content of policies dictated by the authority, and considered their effects on a population roughly divided into three main demographic groups: workers, students and elderly. ",Understanding the role of ___,Spread of misinformation/information,No,,Yes, Italy,Considered and self initiated,"Different kinds of transmission are allowed, with distinct procedures to establish whether the information is accepted or rejected, depending on the epistemic attitude of the receiving agent.

While extended lockdowns should be discouraged, they represent a more desirable option than a quick but stronger epidemics causing the breakdown of hospitals. A malfunctioning health system will not only further increase the high mortality rate dictated by the virus, but it will also be unable to fulfill its ordinary duties. Thus, we assume that a long epidemics which remains sustainable for the health system will cause less damage than a fast but deadly one. We halt the simulation when the infection has disappeared.

Assumptions (implied)

Additionally, we exploit the mean of their distinct daily contacts also to rule the passing of the days; a new day begins once each type of agent reaches the mean of their daily contacts reported above. These values are reached in average after 20 repetitions of the routine that regulates the movements of the agents.

We also model a scenario in which hard deterrents for breaking the rules are applied: these mimic the imposition of fines or the application of penal prosecution to those who do not comply. While in a normal scenario without deterrents up to 50% of misinformed agents will break the lockdown, in the scenario with deterrents the proportion goes down to 10%. Additionally, if strict security personal measures are imposed, misinformed agents will also have an infection rate doubled compared to agents who have accepted the ground truth: this is intended to model their refusal to comply with the required use of PPE and safety measures.

Limitation

The analysis developed so far accounts for a static analysis of the population’s attitude 
towards information. In other words, the number of paranoid agents remains fixed over time, and only the attitude towards information of agents change, primarily of standard agents who get influenced by paranoid ones. This obviously has the limitation of not considering possible variations in the fraction of population which is considered the cause of misinformation spread. In fact, this number can be different across different cultures and countries, and also the situation they experience and the results obtained by specific strategies can have an effect on how people decide to start trusting (or stop trusting) the information shared by the authority. 

Limitations (implied)

We foresee a number of extensions and improvement to this model. We have not taken in consideration the possibility of preventive measures against the diffusion of the virus. In the current setting, the containment measure are applied when 1% of the total population is infected. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of misinformation in a situation of emergency. However, it would be also compelling to study the effects of misinformation in a setting more oriented on preventive measures to block a possible outbreak of the virus. Moreover, our agents are epistemically stubborn, and their attitude does not change in the presence of new information, especially related to the effectiveness of containment measures: it would be a significant improvement the extension of this model with a counteracting information activity which might induce previously misinformed agents to change their attitude. This would allow to trace back the curves illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14. Finally, on a conceptually harder issue, it would be interesting to identify conditions under which paranoid agents can have a healthy effect, in particular when the authorities are not trustworthy or subject to mistakes due to inaccuracy, incompetence, or incomplete and misinterpreted information.",Yes,https://github.com/LorenzoPrandi/Paranoid,No,,One discipline,Other Non-S&E Fields,Philosophy ,"Department of Philosophy,

Finally, in Study 2 we assume that each receipt is assigned to one consumer. However, only a limited number of stores oblige consumers to shop alone (during the COVID19 pandemic), thus our study excludes the presence of families or couples buying together

Specifically, this research adopts agent-based simulation to describe the consumer spatial behavior within a store, assuming that consumers are not equally distributed, and move irregularly within the area

Thirdly, we assume that maximum 100 consumers enter the store (less than the maximum physical capacity of the store) not considering social distancing measures

In the hypothetical scenario, we specifically assume that each consumer visit on average three areas of the store and that the time spent in each area is the same (temporal distance of 100 steps), stay in each area up to 1/3 of the total time, and move of half meter for each temporal step after each area.

It is realistic to assume that the point of sale would be visited by at least one infect, since COVID19 symptoms can be showed up to 15 days after having a contact with an infect, and many infects do not show symptoms even if they already contracted the disease (Chu et al., 2020).

Daycare and School Opening Scenarios
We simulated 2 opening scenarios, (eTable 4 in the Supplement). First, we modeled a counterfactual scenario in which daycares and schools did not reopen on September 15, 2020 (scenario A). Second, we modeled a scenario in which schools and daycares reopened on September 15, 2020, (scenario B) but with several measures in place to limit within-school transmission of COVID-19:

NPI Scenarios
We modeled 3 community-based NPI scenarios (eTable 4 in the Supplement) in Ontario at the beginning of October 2020 in response to increasing confirmed daily case incidence from 185 cases on September 1 to 675 cases on September 30 (eFigures 8-10 in the Supplement). First, we modeled a scenario in which no additional NPIs were enacted so that the increase in case numbers observed in September continued, unabated, until October 31, 2020 (scenario 1). Second, we modeled a scenario in which community-based NPIs were enacted on October 1, 2020, that resulted in a reduction in contacts outside of households to 40% of the value observed prepandemic, including closing of workplaces to nonessential workers, and a reduction in the probability of transmission per contact of 50% compared with the recalibrated values within household and other settings (scenario 2). Third, we modeled a scenario in which the increase of new infections was limited to 0.8% per day, replicating the reduced increase of confirmed cases in the CCM plus database for the first 15 days of October (scenario 3) (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Table 1. Key Input Parameters for the Agent-Based Model for COVID-19 Transmission

It is important to note that our model assumed that measures would be taken in schools to mitigate spread of the virus by reducing high school class sizes, having students remain in the same classroom rather than moving among them, requiring universal mask-wearing, and closing classrooms when more than 2 confirmed SARS-CoV2 infections occurred within any 2-week period",Stay at home; Wear a mask; Get medical treatment; Get tested;  contact tracing,"Symptomatic individuals could seek health care, be confirmed as cases, and either be admitted to hospital or sent home to quarantine until recovered.

A proportion of asymptomatic cases would be detected through contact tracing, reported as confirmed cases, and quarantined until recovery. Individuals who were symptomatic but sought neither health care nor testing and undetected individuals who were asymptomatic would be free to transmit virus in household and nonhousehold settings.

Second, we modeled a scenario in which schools and daycares reopened on September 15, 2020, (scenario B) but with several measures in place to limit within-school transmission of COVID-19: daycare centers were capped at 10 children, primary and elementary class sizes were capped at 23 students, and high school classes were capped at 15 students; students remained in their assigned classrooms for the school day rather than moving among classrooms; universal masking was in place; in designated high schools in urban areas, students attended school only on alternate weekdays; and if more than 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19 occurred in a daycare or classroom less than 2 weeks apart, the daycare or classroom was closed for 14 days, with the children in the class excluded from school rather than moved to another classroom (eTable 4 in the Supplement).",Yes,"Mixing of individuals was assumed to occur randomly within the included settings based on the mean number of close contacts per day prior to the institution of NPIs in March and April 2020 from a contact survey, the CONNECT study13 (Table 1; eMethods and eFigures 2-4 in the Supplement).",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)

Limitations and Strengths
Our study has limitations. Like all models, our ABMCT is a simplification of complex, dynamic patterns of interactions and viral transmission in real populations.

Latent, incubation, and infectious periods were assumed to be fixed rather than drawn from distributions, which may have caused an underestimation of the uncertainty of pandemic trajectories but would not have affected the mean results.

Recalibration refers to a similar process for adjusting the input parameters of the agent-based model for September 2020. The recalibrated model was then used to generate estimates for school opening and community-based nonpharmaceutical interventions in September and October 2020.

Statistical Analysis
The 2 school reopening and 3 community-based NPI scenarios created 6 combinations, 1A to 3B (eTable 4 in the Supplement). For each combination, we ran 100 repetitions of the ABMCT. In addition, 2 deterministic 1-way sensitivity analyses were conducted using the 2A and 2B parameter sets and either allowing the effectiveness of within-school mitigation to vary or the relative effectiveness of community NPIs to vary.

Classroom Closures
The median (interquartile range [IQR]) numbers of classroom closures for scenarios involving school reopening was estimated to be 1726 (1523-1943) classrooms with lack of community-based NPI implementation (scenario 1B), 1051 (957-1149) classrooms with NPI implementation (scenario 2B), and 587 (493-671) classrooms with replication of observed COVID-19 case counts in early October (scenario 3B) (Table 2; eFigure 14 and eFigure 15 in the Supplement), with most closures occurring in primary and elementary schools. For teachers and students, median (IQR) numbers of infections acquired within schools were estimated to be 493 (435-569) infections in scenario 1B, 421 (373-482) infections in scenario 2B, and 167 (145-203) infections in scenario 3B, while the median (IQR) numbers acquired in the community were 15 892 (14 837-16 679) infections in scenario 1B, 9643 (9008-10 415) infections in scenario 2B, and 7265 (6982-7830) infections in scenario 3B, corresponding to median (IQR) percentages of total infections acquired in schools estimated at 3.15% (2.79% 3.55%) in scenario 1B, 4.19% (3.80%-4.60%) in scenario 2B, and 2.37% (2.02% 2.86%) in scenario 3B (Table 2; eFigure 14 and eFigure 15 in the Supplement) among an estimated 307 921 daycare children and staff, 1 562 402 elementary school students and staff, and 713 948 high school students and staff.22,23

Daily New Confirmed COVID-19 Cases
When community-based NPIs were not implemented (ie, scenarios 1A and 1B), the mean number of daily new confirmed cases on October 31, 2020, were estimated to be 4414 (95% credible interval [CrI], 3491-5382) cases with schools closed (scenario 1A) vs 4740 (95% CrI, 3863-5691) cases with schools reopened (scenario 1B) (Figure 1A; eTable 5, eFigure 16, and eFigure 17 in the Supplement). If community-based NPIs were implemented (scenarios 2A and 2B), the mean number of daily new confirmed cases on October 31, 2020, was estimated to be 714 (95% CrI, 568-908) cases with schools closed (scenario 2A) vs 780 (95% CrI, 580-993) cases with schools reopened (scenario 2B) (Figure 1B; eTable 5, eFigure 18, and eFigure 19 in the Supplement). For the scenarios in which the change in the increase of observed case counts in early October 2020 was replicated (scenarios 3A and 3B), the mean number of daily new confirmed cases on October 31, 2020, was estimated to be 777 (95% CrI, 621-993) cases with schools closed (scenario 3A), vs 803 (95% CrI, 617-990) cases with schools reopened (scenario 3B) (Figure 1C; eTable 5, eFigure 20, and eFigure 21 in the Supplement).

Results of simulations are shown for scenarios (1B, 2B, and 3B; eTable 4 in the Supplement) in which schools were modeled to reopen on September 15, 2020. Estimated median values and IQRs were obtained from 100 model repetitions for each scenario

Modeled NPI scenarios may not precisely reflect the actual implementation of public health policy in Ontario but have the advantage of quantitatively determining the outcomes associated with school reopenings across a range of community-based NPI possibilities with robust qualitative results

Both shifts (i.e., day and night) are assumed to last for the same number of hours, which is between 8 and 9 working hours from Monday to Friday.

This assumption was made to provide results that allow identifying trends and emerging behavior from the construction workers regarding the spread of COVID-19 with multiple labor shifts, as revealing the emergent system's behavior is the aim of using an agent-based modeling approach.

It is assumed that the more workers are assigned to a shift, the higher the probabilities are going to be for workers to get infected as the workers' density increases. The contagion rate percentages are lower than in previous studies [11] as it is assumed that as cities and countries are re-opening, the spread of the virus is more controlled.

11 The tested people received the test results the following day. If they tested positive, they were quarantined.

Tests are conducted on 30% of the symptomatic cases, which is the same as before the state of emergency.

When travel restrictions targeting a certain metropolitan area were in place, contacts of outside residents that took place in the target metropolitan area were randomly selected with a certain probability and cancelled. At the same time, contacts of residents of the target metropolitan area that took place in the other metropolitan area were also randomly selected with a certain probability and cancelled.

When working-from-home was in place, workers who were in teleworkable jobs9 were assumed to work from home with a certain probability, which corresponded to the partial deactivation of such workers’ contacts in their workplaces and anonymous contacts in metropolitan areas. When restaurants’ opening hours were shortened, contacts in metropolitan areas decreased by a certain probability.

This is because the proportion of people who can work from home is limited, accounting for 43% of all workers,16 and 19% of the total national population.

Travel restrictions are assumed to decrease long-distance travels by 50% (SankeiBiz, 2021). Additionally, it is assumed that the possible workers work from home with probability 70% (Japan Business Federation, 2021), and shortened restaurants’ opening hours reduce the fluid contacts in metropolitan areas by 75%.17",Stay at home; Get tested,"2.4. Interventions (also see Tables 4-5)

Simulations presented in the following part test the effects of three measures: travel restrictions, working-from-home, and shortening of restaurants’ opening hours.

(i) First, starting from the same proportion of the recovered population as of the initial date of the target horizon, the increase in cases was reproduced under the scenario that the daily tests were conducted on the randomly selected 30% of all symptomatic people.11

11 The tested people received the test results the following day. If they tested positive, they were quarantined.

A hypothetical simple measure, reducing all types of contacts, was also considered to obtain intuition on that level.

Event restriction refers to the upper bound of the size of the fluid contact groups.18",Yes,"1. Obtain the probability of a resident in each prefecture to visit every prefecture using the location data of mobile phone as of February 1st, 2019.6

6 The data, which contain the information on the location of 80 million people, was provided by NTT DOCOMO, the largest cell phone company in Japan.

During the nation-level travel restriction scenario, the contact of long-distance travelers to all metropolitan areas decreased by 90%, a figure similar to the real decrease in May 2020, during the first state of emergency (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, 2020b).

In working-from-home scenario, workers who were in teleworkable jobs worked from home with a decrease in contact probability by 49%, similar to the averaged real decrease from June to September 2020.13

13 Source data were surveys regarding teleworking that were confidentially provided by the Cabinet Office.

In the scenario of shortening restaurants’ opening hours, contacts in metropolitan areas decreased by 36% in Tokyo during August 2020 when restaurants were required to shorten their opening hours.14

14 Sources were the mobility data confidentially provided to the author by NTT DOCOMO.

Travel restrictions are assumed to decrease long-distance travels by 50% (SankeiBiz, 2021). Additionally, it is assumed that the possible workers work from home with probability 70% (Japan Business Federation, 2021), and shortened restaurants’ opening hours reduce the fluid contacts in metropolitan areas by 75%.17

17 Mobility in Tokyo decreased by roughly 50% according to V-RESAS (https://v-resas.go.jp/prefectures/13), which corresponds to a 75% decrease in the number of contacts in this study’s results.

18 In Japan, the government has restricted the size of the event to be less than 5000 people. In the simulation, the limit size was interpreted as a large number that would rarely be realized. Since the model assumed that the number of contact groups in the metropolitan area followed a Poisson distribution with a probability of 10, such a large size corresponded to 17, which achieved a probability of 1%.",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
Thus, the model assumes that the true number of the infected people in each age group is three-fold of the reported cases.

To create fluid contacts reflecting such features in the transfer procedure, the model assumed that the population in each of the eight largest metropolitan areas was shuffled every period; in each time-step, people gathered in each metropolitan area depending on their own travel destinations and the probability of whether they travelled or stayed at their hometowns.

Therefore, by naturally assuming that the place where people bought the cell phones are their residence, one can obtain the proportion of people from regions at a certain place and time, and as a result, the probability of the residents of each prefecture visiting every prefecture is estimated.

Assuming that people have preferences in choosing traveling destinations, allocate travel destination to each resident in each prefecture, using its distribution obtained in step 3.

Determine the contact group: assuming that each person has contact with N people,7 create a contact group in each metropolitan area.

When working-from-home was in place, workers who were in teleworkable jobs9 were assumed to work from home with a certain probability, which corresponded to the partial deactivation of such workers’ contacts in their workplaces and anonymous contacts in metropolitan areas.

The present analysis assumed that people homogeneously followed the decrease in the travel frequency under travel restriction policy by abstracting away from such bias for simplicity. Teleworkable jobs include managerial positions, specialized and skilled workers, office workers, and the uncategorized workers; sales staffs, service workers, farmers, factory workers, and operators in construction and transportation industry were assumed as unable to work from home.

Starting from the snapshot stored in 3.1, it was assumed that the interventions that were taken in the target horizon were introduced from the first day.

The baseline scenario assumed that testing was conducted on 30% of the symptomatic people that were randomly selected. To compare the effects of the interventions, each scenario assumed that on the day the daily confirmed cases at the national level hit 3,000, only one of the interventions was taken on top of dailytesting.12

In every scenario, it was assumed that (i) a randomly selected person became infected on the first day; (ii) each intervention was taken the following day, and; (iii) it was in place until the last day.

Here, the rate of decrease in positive cases was estimated assuming that the same figures and interventions had been realized in the same proportion on the first day of the state of emergency. Travel restrictions are assumed to decrease long-distance travels by 50% (SankeiBiz, 2021). Additionally, it is assumed that the possible workers work from home with probability 70% (Japan Business Federation, 2021), and shortened restaurants’ opening hours reduce the fluid contacts in metropolitan areas by 75%.17

Since the model assumed that the number of contact groups in the metropolitan area followed a Poisson distribution with a probability of 10, such a large size corresponded to 17, which achieved a probability of 1%.

While assuming that the conversion rate of the number of newly diagnosed cases nationwide in relation to that in Tokyo is six to one, the estimation shows that it takes more than a month for the number of diagnosed cases to decrease to 250 per day in Tokyo. 19

In all scenarios, daily tests and event restrictions are assumed to be continued, as in the state of emergency; travel restrictions, working from home, and restaurants’ shortening of their opening hours are assumed to be moderately lifted depending on the circumstances (see Table 6 for the degree of easing).

Extending restaurants’ opening hours increases the number of contacts in metropolitan areas, assuming that mobility recovers to the level when the restaurants are required to close at 22:00 in August 2020.

Limitations
Nonetheless, the model has abstracted several issues, mainly to reduce the time for simulation.

However, as these data should have changed over time, contact networks described in the model possibly misinterprets the reality, which is a limitation of the analysis.

Limitations (implied)

One element that has not been considered in this work is the link between the number of vaccinations, the burden on health facilities, and the resulting variation in vaccine administration rates. However, the bottleneck in the first phase of the vaccination campaign in Lombardy was the pace of dose production by pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, future scientific studies should investigate that this relationship did not have a significant impact on the final outcome. 

The proposed approach can be also further improved by means of a more customized ABM. First, although an attempt has always been made to identify the parameters that characterize the pandemic in Lombardy, some of the sources used refer to other contexts [35,43,44]. 

Secondly, some phenomena about the spread of infection can be specifically modeled, such as periods of mass vacation that alter the normal activities of individuals [50], and the so-called ""pandemic fatigue"" that can occur over time [51]. Third, as with any modeling study, some assumptions have been made when simulating the epidemic. Unlike other countries [52], no detailed data are available on contact tracing performance in Italy. Thus, it has not been possible to do directly data-driven modeling of contact tracing, but assumptions had to be made.

[46] to tailor a Covasim model over Vietnam.",Yes,"The number of diagnoses drastically underestimates the real number of infections, thus it can't be used to initialize the simulation. To overcome this, the test yield ratio curve has been rescaled and used as a proxy to estimate the actual infections. In detail, the infection curve has been estimated as follows: where ˆi(t): estimation of actual infections, ty(t): ratio of positive swabs / total swabs, ∫ u ty(u) du: integral of ty between February 24 and July 15, 2020, and k: cumulative infection as of July 15, 2020, estimated by the serological survey

The cost function g(θ) has been optimized using the grid search method, again following [46]. The overall transmission rate β ranged from 0.01875 to 0.01975 with an increment of 0.0001, and the seed s ranged from 0 to 499 with an increment of 1. The best 30 combinations of parameters out of 5500 trials have been selected and included in the final model. Diagnoses vs. deaths data have been weighted in the ratio 2:1, which has been found to be the best tradeoff between curve fitting of deaths and diagnoses.

The progression of the daily incidence of Variant Alpha is consistent with nationwide data reported by the Italian National Institute of Health [32], although these data are not explicitly accounted for by the cost function used for the optimization. Furthermore, the attack rate among individuals identified through contact tracing is consistent with the one reported for Italy. Between September 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, the attack rate found in 30 runs of the model ranged from 15.2% to 20.8% (median: 17.6%), while it has been reported to be 20.3% in Italy between July and December 2020 [49].

The model assumes that COVID-19 is transmitted only between human agents and ignores the transmission of the disease in closed environments (e.g., through contaminated surfaces).

In addition, since adherence to social distancing in communities is not uniform [27], it is assumed that agents do not adhere to social distancing guidelines uniformly (as described in Section Social Distancing). 

In this model, it is assumed that if the complete lockdown scenario is not activated, human agents who are not receiving treatment can move up to 30 m in any direction (randomly between 0 and 360◦) within the environment during a specific time of the day (6 a.m. to 2 p.m.) based on the Moore neighborhood (a two-dimensional square lattice containing a central cell and the eight surrounding cells [30]); however, under the complete lockdown scenario, human agents are limited to move up to 3 m in any direction per time step (within the timeframe listed above).

It is assumed that the maximum gathering size is 50 people for each urban land use.

It is assumed that the process of disease transmission between human agents occurs only from 6 am to 12 am.

It is assumed that the recovered human will be immune to the virus during the simulation.

In this model, it is assumed that human agents do not uniformly adhere to this policy.

As explained in Section Social Gatherings, it is assumed that a social gathering size would be a maximum of 50 individuals; thus, it is assumed that this restriction is in the form of reducing the gathering size for human agents.

Thus, it is assumed that only susceptible human agents who have not yet been infected could be vaccinated.

To assess the effect of population vaccination on the spread of the disease, it is assumed that 50% of the susceptible population is vaccinated on different days of the epidemic.

Limitations
This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. The COVID-19 data used in the model were mostly extracted from previous studies, and the data accuracy was not fully investigated. Future work can consider uncertainties in the data and processes. The model assumed a closed environment, whereas humans can move out of the environment, which can be examined in future studies. This study assumed that all COVID-19 variants have similar virulence and transmissibility during the study period; however, this proposition is arguable, and it should be considered in future studies. The model also assumed complete immunity from re-infection for individuals who have received a vaccine or recovered from the disease, which is not realistic. Further research can examine the effect of different vaccine doses on the epidemic. Additionally, information about the control scenarios and people’s responsiveness to these measures was not available, as the primary focus of this study was on designing control scenarios and observing the changes in epidemic behaviors. In the future, more realistic assumptions and evaluations of the impact of these public health measures on the epidemic can be conducted by gathering such information. For example, the stringency index, which measures the degree of strictness of public health policies over time, can be incorporated into the model to improve the evaluation of public health measures.",Yes,https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/su151813827/s1,Yes,CovaSim,Three or more different disciplines,"Engineering, Life Sciences, Social Sciences","Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Geography","Department of GIS, Faculty of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering, K.

This is because Ontario’s LTCFs COVID-19 infection data were not reported in a systematic manner and do not represent the actual state of the outbreak, particularly in the first wave of the pandemic from March to May 2020 [37]. As a result, verifying the accuracy of the model via initial infection data is not a viable option. However, reported deaths are more accurate and can be used to assess the model results

Figure 4 shows the minimum, mean, and maximum simulated (predicted) death toll based on 500 Monte Carlo simulation runs of the baseline model.

To assess the model accuracy, we first compared the number of resident deaths at fifty days predicted by the model, against the number of resident deaths at fifty days observed in five LTCF outbreaks. The five facilities chosen were the ones that suffered from major outbreaks during the first infection wave in 2020. Facility sizes were close to the size of the LTCF based on which we created the contact matrix. To account for the varied sizes of the LTCFs, the parameters were set to reflect the actual number of residents as well as the average number of staff for an LTCF of that size in each particular LTCF

To examine the effectiveness of PPE use and COVID-19 testing in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in LTCFs, we simulated three sets of scenarios: one per control measure, and one as a combination of both. Each scenario was simulated 500 times using a Monte Carlo model that randomly varied simulation parameters, as in [21].

With 20 tests per day, the cumulative number of predicted deaths at 50 days was reduced to 54. Introducing testing at this level did decrease the average number of resident deaths by 11.5%. However, the wide distribution of results across the 500 simulation runs makes it difficult to conclude if this testing level is actually effective at reducing the severity of an outbreak.

We have not incorporated changes in individuals’ behaviours as a result of implementing the shielding and/or cohorting interventions into the model. Therefore, we have not captured how such changes would affect the outcomes. As the changes in behaviour in the presence of interventions and the relationships between behavioural changes and risks of transmission are difficult to predict,25 it is essential to continue to closely monitor outbreaks in care homes. Furthermore, as our model has assumed that visitors only come into contact with the resident whom they visit and do not interact with other residents, the effect of loosening visiting policy may be underestimated. However, relaxing this assumption will lead to the same impact as increasing the number of visitors allowed. Also, interactions between visitors and residents other than the one whom they visit are unlikely to happen amidst the ongoing pandemic

We assumed that recovered individuals are immune to reinfection throughout the simulated time (i.e. 6 months). We assumed that all staff and residents are susceptible at the beginning of the simulation

In cohorting interventions, we assumed that residents and staff are split evenly into smaller, self-contained units within a care home and examined two scenarios: individuals including staff and residents across units do not interact and interactions across units occur at the probability of 20%.

We assume, therefore, that agents do not need to identify norms dynamically during the simulation (e.g., via imitation or learning88)

Moreover, the approach in Alechina et al.90 assumes that violations can be reliably detected, and the institution is able to effectively sanction violating agents; neither of these assumptions holds in our setting.

In our simulation, instead, we apply n2 only to customers and clients of these businesses, and assume all businesses to which the norm applies (Table 5) are indeed closed.

The one exception here is if the next activity is of type WORK, which is assumed not to be temporally flexible

The PanSim platform has been designed to efficiently scale complex multicontagion simulations. It assumes that the socio-psychological models that are being simulated using it are computationally heavy

Nevertheless, the results reported above show that behavioral responses of individual agents to normative interventions, and not just the effect of an a priori uniform assumption on the level of compliance, can be studied through our proposed simulation framework.

Limitations
Despite the recent proliferation of epidemic agent-based models, however, the modeled dynamics of individual decision-making are still limited

Various surveys on the use of decision-making agents in social simulations identify scalability as a key issue that limits their applicability. The difficulty lies in scaling these individual models to the population sizes required for meaningful studies due to their computational complexity. Indeed, the vast majority of solutions for epidemic agent based simulation in the literature falls in one of two categories: frameworks or platforms that can simulate millions of individuals with simple behaviors (e.g., based on simple state machines ‘‘triggers’’-based behavior), and frameworks or platforms that consider more complex behaviors and social dynamics (e.g., agents that act according to their own agenda and preferences, in a social context, and deliberate about norm compliance) but have limited scalability

we observe that: (a) the literature on agent-based epidemic simulations is split between models that consider only individuals with simple behaviors (e.g., based on simple finite state machines or drawn from distribution) but scale to hundreds of millions of individuals, and models that consider more complex behaviors (e.g., considering age matrices, social differences, and individual choices) but have limited scalability

Limitations of 2APL for simulation. As the agents can dynamically update their belief, goal, and plan bases, 2APL allows the implementation of many forms of complex proactive and reactive behavior.36 However, 2APL has two main limitations that make it unsuitable for simulation

Limitation 1 (scalability). 2APL is no exception to other agent programming languages with respective to limited scalability (as discussed in Section 2). More specifically, in 2APL, the number of CPU resources that can efficiently be used in parallel is severely limited by the tight integration of agent execution and the execution of actions in the environment. This approach essentially makes 2APL a discrete-event-based system, where the events are any action performed by any agent in the environment. Because of the reasons outlined in the previous section, this poses an issue for efficiency if considered in a (distributed) simulation context.

Limitation 2 (lack of time-step synchronization). As discussed above, 2APL allows agents to directly change the environment by their plan execution. As a consequence, the agents are executed asynchronously both from each other and from the environment, and 2APL does not contain an explicit notion of time. This means that agents may have different—possibly inconsistent—information about the environment’s current state. Furthermore, because compute time of agents can differ due to the scheduling of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), in a simulation context, some agents may be able to perform more deliberation cycles than others in the same (simulated) time posing difficulties for the repeatability of a simulation.

A caveat is that the number of confirmed cases likely under-counted the number of actual cases substantially, especially early in the epidemic, due to limited testing

PanSim, a novel epidemic simulation platform that can (a) integrate realistic behavior models that can capture the complex social dynamics of individual decision-making, (b) incorporate existing agent behavior modeling frameworks written in high-level languages such as Python or Java, (c) seamlessly combine fast epidemic simulation code—written in a low-level language but easily specified in a simple declarative language—with these behavior models, and (d) exploit distributed memory HPC systems. Second, in Section 4, we have presented Sim-2APL, an agent programming language, based on 2APL, that supports the flexible implementation and execution of deliberative agents in discrete time distributed simulations executed with PanSim to implement a realistic human-like behavior model of agents’ reasoning about compliance with nonpharmaceutical intervention norms

",No,,Validation,"Validate, validating, validity ",Yes,"We assess the performance of SIDD-NC using Spearman Rank Correlation, RMSE, and percent RMSE at a state and county level. We conduct the analysis for the period of March 2020 through November 2020 as well as in shorter time increments to assess both the recreation of the pandemic curve as well as day-to-day transmission of SARS- CoV-2 within the population. We find that SIDD-NC performs well against the datasets in the ensemble, generating an estimate of infections that is robust both spatially and temporally.

By utilizing an ensemble of datasets to account for uncertainty in any singular dataset, this study offers an approach for model development during a health crisis as the crisis remains ongoing in the absence of reliable and complete ground-truth data sets

Finally, for each of the ensemble datasets, the daily values were smoothed using a 7-Day rolling average to account for noisiness.

Multiple metrics were used for comparison. We used a Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Test to investigate the temporal similarity of the SIDD-NC estimated number of infections and the number from the data ensemble (visual inspection of the scatterplots showed non-linearity). We used root mean squared error (RMSE) to measure the magnitude of error, as well as a percent infection-weighted RMSE, which was calculated by dividing the RMSE by the average number of infections per day from the comparison dataset to assist in contextualizing the magnitude of error. This metric is effectively a root mean squared standardized error (RMSSE), however, we use a percent scale rather than the standard ratio to contextualize the prediction variance within infections per day. Because infections per day varied across time periods, percent RMSE for each time period has a unique denominator. For the county-level analyses, the use of percent RMSE normalizes the values to account for the large differences in population sizes (and infections) among counties.

Overall, the SIDD-NC model estimates were highly correlated with the NCDHHS-TEST (R → 0.77) and NC-COVID (R → 0.82) estimates, moderately correlated with the NCDHHS-PUB (R → 0.56) estimates, and moderately/weakly correlated with the JHU (R → 0.43) estimates. The correlation results from the subperiods reveal nuances in the relationships. SIDD-NC and NC-COVID had nearly perfect positive correlation in seven of nine time periods, but had no relationship in one and nearly perfect negative correlation in another. In all time periods except one, SIDD-NC and NCDHHS-TEST had extremely high correlation, while in one time period, the two had moderate negative correlation. For NCDHHS-PUB and JHU, the correlations were extremely strong and positive in some time periods and extremely strong and negative in others, which led to the moderate/weak overall correlation. Considering the correlation from the perspective of the time periods, we observed that the results were not consistent (e.g., all positive and strong) for any particular time period; most had a mixture of two models with high strong positive correlation with SIDD-NC and two models with middling to strong negative correlation (see Table 2).

Overall, there is fairly low error for most of the counties in this analysis, though there are several with percent RMSE over 100% (Fig. 4). There is much weaker correlation on a county-level between JHU and SIDD-NC (Fig. 4). However, the JHU county-level analysis has low error for much of the state, with only one county (Watauga) in the highest class of percent RMSE (427%) (Fig. 4). There is clear difference in county-level correlation between the NCDHHS-TEST and JHU ana lyses, however, the raw RMSE maps appear visually similar despite JHU producing more counties in higher error classes. This is due to the higher error in both analyses occurring in the counties where infections were consistently higher. These counties (Wake, Mecklenburg, Cumberland, Onslow, New Hanover, Durham, Orange, Guilford, Forsyth, and Iredell) are the most urbanized and population dense in the state. Though the raw RMSE maps for the JHU and NCDHHS-TEST analyses are visually quite similar, the percent RMSE maps show clearly different spatial patterns. This is due largely to the difference in estimate of average infections per day per county generated by the different datasets.

The highest level of agreement is seen between SIDD-NC and the NC- COVID Model. Strong agreement between these two specifically suggests that SIDD-NC provides a plausible reconstruction of the COVID-19 

transmission curve follows a similar temporal pattern as these datasets. The percent RMSE for the entire ensemble was under 50% more than half the time, indicating overall reasonably low error given the amount of new infections generated per day. The moderate to strong correlation and low percent RMSE at this spatial scale support agreement between SIDD-NC and the data ensemble on a county level.

Table 2 Correlation values for each dataset in the ensemble for the full study time as well as temporal analysis timelines.

Table 3 RMSE and percent RMSE values for each dataset in the ensemble for the full study time as well as temporal analysis timelines.

This approach, like all modeling approaches, is not without uncertainty. In this ensemble, there are discrepancies between the data published on the NCDHHS public dashboard (NCDHHS-PUB), the JHU Mortality Data, and the NCDHHS reported clinical testing data (NCDHHS-TEST) even though, in theory, all three sets should be originating from the same primary source at NCDHHS. Testing difficulties at the beginning of the pandemic, as well as our use of a static multiplier to estimate infections from reported cases and mortality for the entirety of the pandemic time, may also be contributing to the differences between the JHU and NCDHHS-TEST infection maps on a county level, and resulting difference in correlation. The relatively weak correlation of both is likely due to the NCDHHS-TEST and JHU datasets both under estimating infections.

Even with the acknowledged uncertainty, this study finds that SIDD- NC performs well at both a county and state level and during smaller increments of time as well as for the entire study period. As a tool, SIDD- NC is a thoroughly informed approach to estimating the true burden of infection that accounts for the ways uncertainty and variability on an individual level and across different spatial scales create the observed outbreak dynamics on a population level

The results of this validation study indicate that this emphasis on accuracy as a modeling approach is both reasonable and useful, as SIDD-NC reliably produces a well-correlated recreation of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina.

Our model denotes the health status of individuals 
by borrowing the idea of the SEIR model (Hethcote, 
2000). However, we do not simply employ the standard 'Susceptible', 'Exposed', 'Infectious' and 'Recovered' status in the modeling. Because the SEIR model does not have 'vaccinated' or 'dead' status in its concept, it makes it not suitable for COVID-19 infection and vaccination studies. To overcome this deficiency of SEIR, we add the 'Vaccinated' and 'Dead' status and increase the resolution of description of the health status in the meantime, see the details in the model building part (Sec. 2.2).

These measures together encourage the public to take tests as well as help to detect individuals with infectivity, as can be inferred in Figure 1A, where we sum up the number of PCR tests conducted on a daily basis (2020.01.24 ~ 2022.11.30).

In pursuit of model perfection, we shall make changes to population structure in the near future. Third, in this research we randomly select agents to conduct PCR tests, whereas in real world agents can freely choose whether to undertake PCR tests or not, based on their judgements to their own health.

Assuming the agents with the same degree behave similarly (Barabasi & Posfai, 2016), we employ degree block approxi­mation to place the agents that have the same degree into the same block (group). This approach allows us to create a separate compartmental model in each group of agents based on their degrees. 

We assume that symptomatic infections tend to have fewer movements and contact activities, while asymptomatic infections may maintain their behaviors as normal. 

In our simulation model, we assume the system is consistent, meaning that no inflow nor outflow of agents occurs during the study period. The total number of agents remains the same throughout the study period. In addition, combined policies are consistently imple­mented during the test period. Thus, the timing of the policy imple­mentation is not a factor influencing the calculation of the costs and the projection of infections. Based on these assumptions, we consider the costs of the policies to be proportional to the size of the population affected by the policies. Accordingly, we can assign a cost factor to each group of the population under specific policies to roughly quantify the costs of the policies.

To compare costs of different local policies, we focused mainly on relative values of costs, which indicate extra savings or expenses of one policy compared to another. In other words, the cost values are not required to be precise in this analysis since relative costs are sufficient for us to identify cost-effective policies. As long as relative costs are reasonable, the assumption is defensible.

Assumptions (implied)

We find that, the corre­lation coefficient is high enough, indicating that the population of each CBG captured in the mobile phone data is significantly proportional to the population estimated from demographic surveys. In this respect, we consider that the mobile phone data could represent the populations in CBGs in a county, and can capture the mobility of individuals in the population between areas. 

Limitations

Our study also confronts some limitations, specifically in the data set we use. It should be noted that the data does not cover the contact activities of all populations. For example, the activities from people who do not opt-in to the data-sharing contract of the data provider cannot be captured. Contact activities that occurred in non-points of interest may not be included in building the contact links in the network. These limitations in the dataset notwithstanding, fine-grained mobile phone data is widely adopted in modeling epidemics and informing public health policies (Oliver et al., 2020). In addition, although our model can accurately predict the pandemic using contact networks, the results do not imply the exact causal relation between contact activities and epidemic spread. Further studies are needed in improving the model to infer the in-depth mechanisms of epidemic spread and to substantiate effective policies in pandemic containment.

Any contact between an infectious and susceptible individual is assumed to carry the same probability of transmission, all else being equal.

Critical cases who are in hospital will be admitted to an ICU, with sufficient capacity assumed in the model.

We assume all non-severe cases isolate for a 10-day period immediately following diagnosis. For individuals presenting with severe disease that seek hospital care prior to diagnosis, a test (and consequent diagnosis) is assumed to be carried out once they are admitted to hospital.

This assumption is not robust to major changes in testing policies or behaviours, including, but not limited to, mass testing.

These recovered individuals are assumed to be susceptible to reinfection but are assumed to retain some level of partial immunity, which reduces susceptibility to subsequent exposure. OpenCOVID can capture immunity decay, but for this study we optimistically assume no immunity decay following naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity due to the short-term nature of the simulation period. For naturally acquired immunity due to infection, we assume an 83% transmission blocking effect when/if re-exposed (Hall et al., 2021).

We assume the variant with which an individual is infected is inherited from the infector.

For B.1.351, a 10% increase in transmissibility relative to D614G was assumed (Reichmuth et al., 2021 ). For the primary results reported in this study, we assumed no increased probability of morbidity or mortality due to viral variants.

In this study, we consider only mRNA vaccines and assume all vaccinated individuals receive two doses spaced by 3-weeks with vaccination reaching maximum efficacy 28-days after the first dose (Polack et al., 2020; Baden et al., 2021). We assume the vaccine is 80% transmission blocking and has a further 75% probability of preventing symptoms leading to the observed 95% vaccine efficacy reported in clinical trials (Polack et al., 2020; Baden et al., 2021).

We assumed that 75% of each priority group was willing to be vaccinated.

For all scenarios, we assumed consistent adherence to measures over time. Similar levels of testing to those from early February 2021 to early March 2021 was assumed for these simulations, the potential impact of mass testing or widespread testing outreach was not modelled.

Even with faster vaccination, if individuals who were vaccinated but then became infected caused partial onward transmission (i.e., assuming less than 65% transmission blocking), an even slower NPI relaxation would have been needed to avoid subsequent re-strengthening of measures.

A subset of model parameters (Appendix Table S.1) was calibrated to align model output to six types of epidemiological data, including confirmed cases, patients in hospital, deaths, and prevalence of viral variants (Chen et al., 2021 ) from 18 February 2020–5March 2021 (see Fig. 2 and Appendix Fig. S.1-S.3).

The effect of NPIs on contact rates was also subject to model calibration, where the OCHI index was proportionally scaled to represent a reduction in contacts. See the Appendix for calibration details and outcomes.

This publicly available information is translated into 16 OCHI levels for Switzerland, together with a calibrated multiplicative scaling parameter is used in our model to capture the effect of NPIs in reducing the effective daily number of contacts.

All three importation rates are found through model calibration (see the following section).

2.10. Sensitivity analysis section
To assess the sensitivity of our findings, we simulated scenarios that independently varied several key model parameters related to vaccine characteristics and currently circulating variants of concern (see Table 2 for details).

Since factors other than control measures can strongly influence the course of the epidemic, using a sensitivity analysis we could examine the potential impact of 1) varying properties of variants of concern (VOC), 2) varying vaccine efficacies, and 3) varying levels of vaccine uptake.

Model outcomes were most sensitive to the level of infectiousness of variants of concern observed in Switzerland.

Since these findings may be sensitive to uncertainties in VOC properties, these factors were further explored via sensitivity analysis.",Yes,"Since factors other than control measures can strongly influence the course of the epidemic, using a sensitivity analysis we could examine the potential impact of 1) varying properties of variants of concern (VOC), 2) varying vaccine efficacies, and 3) varying levels of vaccine uptake.

This model simulates the spread of the virus in an artificial economy consisting of thousands of heterogeneous agents and is informed by a large variety of German legal and statistical data. This model is able to simulate containment strategies in a detailed way and allows to study economic, public health, and —to a limited degree— social consequences of the spread of the virus and the containment measures.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",No,,Yes," Germany, UK",Considered and imposed,"If family isolation and workplace isolation is activated, household members or colleagues of a detected infected are isolated.",Stay at home; Get medical treatment; Get tested;  contact tracing,"3. Set up (a stylized version of) the British policy scenario against COVID19 until June 2020 including testing policies, i.e., with corresponding infection detection rates that relate to the test positivity rate in the two countries.

If family isolation and workplace isolation is activated, household members or colleagues of a detected infected are isolated. Minor social distancing (SD) increases the preference of agents to stay at home during leisure phases by 10%. Major SD increases it by 100% and cuts the maximum number of agents met during each phase by 50%. If schools close, children and teachers will stay at home during work phases.

If there is a contact ban, agents may not visit their friends anymore (but still go to non-commercial leisure facilities). Under curfew, agents may only leave their households in order to work.

If sanitary standards are increased, the infection chance goes down to 0% (hospitals), 25% (schools and commercial leisure facilities) and 50% (factories and offices).

Hospital cases are either severe (who require a standard hospital bed) or critical (requiring first an intensive care unit and then —if the treatment is successful—a standard hospital bed during their recovery phase).

In order to confine myself to the research question at hand, I study the public health, economic and social outcomes for only six scenarios: a) The German baseline scenario, b) the corrected UK scenario, which aims to mimic the empirical UK containment policy timeline, c) the corrected UK scenario with the exception that contact tracing is never interrupted, d) the corrected UK scenario, but with German-level testing, e) the corrected UK scenario with both contact tracing and German-level testing, and f) the uncorrected UK scenario, which does not account for the different evolution of the pandemic in the two countries until the beginning of March 2020.",No,,No,,No,,No,,No,,No,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions,"Assumptions (assume)
2. Make the British and the German infection timeline comparable, as the infection can be assumed to have spread differently even before the introduction of strict lockdown measures.

If we assume, however, that testing is somehow targeted at people showing symptoms or identified contacts of infected individuals, the detection rate cannot be independent of the number of infected.

If we assume, however, that the same relation between the number of tests and the number of people tested as in mid-April holds, we can estimate the number of people tested to be approximately 108,000.

If we assume a direct relationship between the number of people tested and the detection rate and take the detection rate as estimated in Mellacher (2020) as given, this corresponds to a detection rate of 8.2% in the beginning of the simulation.

A simple approach to operationalize the assumption of a direct relationship between the test positivity rate and the detection rate is to calibrate the model to a certain detection rate in July and set the detection rates in May and June as linear combinations based on the detection rates until April and July.

In absence of any data on this, I assume the share to be 10%.

Figure 3 finally also shows that the evolution of the pandemic before the usual start of the simulation (i.e., the 11th calendar week of 2020) played a crucial role, as the simulated death toll is considerably smaller, if we assume that the British situation was the same as the German one at period zero (i.e., the “uncorrected” scenario).

Although this is not measurable empirically for the social costs of the crisis in terms of forgone (“thwarted”) leisure activities, it is reasonable to assume that the curfew implemented in the UK was more expensive in this dimension than the “contact ban” introduced in Germany.",No,,Yes," COVID-Town

Since the first British wave was considerably longer and possibly started at a different period of time than the German wave, I adapt the calibration for the present research question.

The contagion rate percentages are lower than in previous studies (Araya, 2021b) as it is assumed that as cities and countries are vaccinating and re-opening, the spread of the virus is better controlled.

2.6. Limitations section
This study suffers from limitations that need to be acknowledged. To use an agent-based modeling approach is necessary to simplify real-life conditions by making assumptions about agents’ behavior. In doing so, real-life conditions may be oversimplified, such as the process of contagion among workers. Another limitation of this study relates with the lack of specificity regarding the multiskilled workers used in the model. The proposed model does not refer to any specific set of skills for construction workers, which may reduce the specificity of the findings of this study. Nonetheless, this assumption provides flexibility to the model to generalize the findings of this study to different contexts.

Another limitation is the lack of data about how construction workers behave in construction projects during the current pandemic context; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the data collection process in construction fields may represent a health risk for researchers and workers.

4.1 Human-to-Human Contact Networks

We assume that R0 is either explicitly given or can implicitly be derived from an ODE-based model specification.

Infected nodes show symptoms and are infectious. Therefore, we assume that their infectiousness is reduced by a factor of γ (γ ≤ 1, sick people will reduce their social activity). Individuals that are hospitalized (or in the ICU) are assumed to be properly quarantined and cannot infect others.

Limitations (implied, as future work)

For future work, it would be interesting to investigate the influence of non-Markovian dynamics. ODE-models naturally correspond to an exponentially distributed residence times in each compartment [49,17]. Moreover, it would be interesting to reconstruct more realistic contact networks. They would allow to investigate the effect of NPIs in the network-based paradigm and to have a well-founded scientific discussion about their efficiency. From a risk-assessment perspective, it would also be interesting to focus more explicitly on worst-case trajectories (taking the model’s inherent stochasticity into account).

One simple option is to assume contact between everybody in the same facility or vehicle.

This would need to be investigated further, but the present method is computationally too expensive (Section 5.1).

5.1. Computational issues section
The computational model used for this paper moves all synthetic persons through their daily plans, i.e. entering and leaving facilities and vehicles as they are in the plan. This is an inefficient implementation for the type of investigation here, where we start with a single seed, and normally only have small clusters. An alternative would be to grow the population as it is needed. Tadić and Melnik [12] present a model that does that. In their model, however, the new persons that are added into the model are created with randomly drawn properties, which is different from our approach, where the synthetic persons have attributes including daily plans that are known from the beginning, and which make up the structure of the model. Possibly, a data structure would need to be found and implemented that could identify those synthetic persons that use the same facilities or vehicles as the contagious persons, and then compute the interaction only with those.

Symptomatic Infected. Agents in this state have been infected and experience symptoms. They are capable of transmitting 
the disease. Symptomatic Infected are further categorised as:
○ Mild. Agents in this state are assumed to experience mild symptoms of COVID-19 and do not have shortness of breath or dyspnoea.
○ Moderate. Agents in this state are assumed to show evidence of lower respiratory disease.
○ Critical. Agents in this state represent individuals with severe or critical illness and who experience respiratory failure.

We assume that the vaccinated agents are immune for a period of time and they can be infected after they lose their immunity.

We assume that people with mild symptoms will not be hospitalised, while people with moderate and severe symptoms will seek treatment at a medical facility. Also, 30% of people with COVID-19 will recover without developing symptoms (Johansson et al., 2021).

Therefore, we assume that the moderate and mild cases have immunity that lasts 3–5 months, while critical cases remain immune for 5– 8 months. For vaccinated individuals, vaccine immunity was set to 3 months. The SurvivalProbability, which is the probability of recovery if not treated, is assumed to be between 0.6 and 0.8 for critical and moderate cases and 0.95 for mild cases (Prescott & Girard, 2020).

When the simulation starts, we define a limited clinic capacity and initial percentages of infected and vaccinated populations. The clinic capacity parameter is defined as the percentage of the population that can be hospitalised. We assume that all agents can be infected and do not have initial immunity.

We investigated the United States COVID-19 cases and ran several scenarios to verify and validate the model and provide initial insights about the effects of vaccination on virus transmission. The input data and the simulation results per scenario are summarised in Tables 2 and 3, respectively

4.1. Verifcation and validation of base model

Various techniques were used for the verification and validation of the base simulation model. First, the tracing verification technique was used. The model was successfully tested for one agent to verify the logical flow, state transition mechanisms for the virus transmission, and total time spent in the clinic for different age groups and symptom types. The model was also verified by observing the animation of the simulation output as well as the agent-based state diagrams.",Yes,"Symptoms develop mostly within 6 days after exposure but may develop as early as 2 days or as late as 14 days (Byrne et al., 2020; Khalili et al., 2020; Levin et al., 2020). Thus, we used PERT distribution. PERT (also called the beta-PERT or three-point estimation technique) is a continuous distribution bounded on both sides and has three inputs: Minimum, Most Likely, and Maximum. We selected PERT as an alternative to the triangular distribution as it has a smoother bell-shaped curve that emphasises less extreme values for the IncubationPeriod, and more weight is given to the estimate that occurs most frequently. The distribution is plotted against a chart, as illustrated in Figure 4.

All results are based on an average of 30 replications.

The simulation scenarios were run for 30 replications to reduce variability.

We also run two-sample t-tests to determine if the changes between scenarios are statistically significant. The significance level (α) was set to 0.05 for the following hypothesis: H0: The average of Group-1ʹs population is considered to be equal to the average of Group-2ʹs population (μ1 = μ2) Η1:The average of Group-1ʹs population is considered to not be equal to the average of Group-2ʹs population (μ1 ≠ μ2) The simulation results for a period of time of 60 days are summarised in the following subsections

We also ran two sample t-tests to determine if the changes between scenarios 1 and 2 are statistically significant. The results indicate that H0 is rejected (p-value= 0.00038; t-statistic = −3.9; not in acceptable range [−2.0244:2.0244]). This means that the difference between the average of scenario 1 and scenario 2 is large enough to be statistically significant, with an observed standardised efect size of 1.23

Also, more people visit the healthcare facility and can receive treatment due to the increased capacity. We also ran two-sample t-tests to determine if the changes between scenarios 2 and 6 are statistically significant. The results indicate that the changes in the metrics between the two scenarios are statistically different, with p-value

As vaccinations per day increase, the percentage of deaths and infected population decrease. Also, the proportion of the population that visits the healthcare facility or is hospitalised decreases. We also ran two-sample t-tests to determine if the changes between scenarios 3 and 5 are statistically significant. The results indicate that the changes in the metrics between the two scenarios are statistically different, with p-value= 0.01, t-statistic= 2.5 (not in the acceptable range [−2.0017: 2.0017]), and observed standard diced effect size of 0.67.

Moreover, the proportion of the population that visits the healthcare facility or is hospitalized significantly drops. We also ran two-sample t-tests to determine if the changes between scenarios 2 and 7 are statistically significant.

Infectious individuals were further divided into symptomatic (ISym) and asymptomatic (IAsym) infectious individuals, with the assumption that asymptomatic infectious individuals are less infectious than symptomatic individuals22 (Fig. 2A)

In our model, we assumed that their infection probability was reduced by the vaccine effectiveness against infection (eS), i.e., the infection probability of vaccinated individuals is 1−eS relative to those of unvaccinated individuals.

In our model, we assumed that infections with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of their vaccination status, provide perfect immunity against re-infection during the time course of the simulation. 

In our model simulation, we assumed that, initially, a certain fraction of 106 individuals had been fully vaccinated and had vaccine-induced immunity. No one possessed immunity from prior infections. A primary case who was fully vaccinated was then imported. We assumed that the imported primary case had been isolated since their last recent exposure to the virus, while other subsequently infected individuals in the community were isolated with a default time delay of 6.8 days (estimated from the mean incubation period and the mean delay from symptom onset to isolation in South Korea27). An example of the transmission events is illustrated in Fig. 2(C). The incubation period, time from exposure to symptom onset, was assumed to follow the gamma distribution with a mean of 5.8 days17

However, since at the time of writing this manuscript, the data on the waning of vaccine effectiveness against Omicron variant infections were not available, we assumed that it wanes at the same rate as for the Delta variant.

Our study, however, has some limitations. First, we assumed that neither infection-acquired nor hybrid immunity existed in the initial population. Second, the model parameters used in this study were based on the 
Delta variant and the BNT162b2 vaccine, which might limit the applicability for the current COVID-19 situation in which the most prominent circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2 is the Omicron (BA.5) variant.

Here, the exposure period is assumed to be gamma-distributed with a mean of Te days.

The size of a workplace is assumed, however, to be gamma-distributed so as to include workplaces of extremely large size.

The spreading probability pc within each of these crowds of agents is assumed to be smaller than those of the household or workplace networks.

We assume the virus spreads with probability p in these social gathering networks.

By assuming that an undetected individual is able to spread the virus for 7 days or more, we classified 137 cases as undetected at the end of the simulated period.

Assuming that some of these cases can be back-traced eventually through routine screening to asymptomatic individuals, our simulation would have uncovered 314 to 604 cases with unknown sources of infection.

The foreign workers constitute only 5.5% of the whole population in our model, and we assume that those who reside in dormitories are poorly connected to the rest of the population.

Here, we assume that there is no imported cases during the period under study. We further assume a full restoration of inter-household social connections while intra-household connections remain unchanged as in CB.

Finally, we assume the social connection within the dormitory network to restore to 50%.

This assumption is reasonable because the number of infected cases ∑T t=0 nt is relatively small compared to the actual population size.

This raises the challenge of having to adapt the agent populations to incorporate the information provided by the coarse-grained data. To do this, two stochastic strategies to correct the model predictions are developed. The ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed observations is used for the joint estimation of the state and some key epidemiological parameters. We conduct experiments with an agent based-model designed for COVID-19 and assess the proposed methodology on synthetic data and on COVID-19 daily reports from Ciudad Auto´noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.

We propose to conduct DA in the space of these aggregated variables. The mapping of the micro into the macro state is straightforward by aggregating the variables of interest for assimilation. But this is not the case for the inverse mapping. The aggregated variables are not necessarily matched with a single microscopic state. In fact, it is likely that many microscopic states of the agent population yield the same aggregated variables. This issue needs to be addressed in order to produce realistic forecasts. Two methodologies are proposed and evaluated in this work to produce the mapping between the macroscopic state to the microscopic state.

We assume that recovered individuals develop immunity for the duration of the simulation, but note that this would be unrealistic for longer-term simulations. 

This contact matrix is assumed fixed in this work, but in order to model this matrix in a more realistic manner, mobility data from smartphones could be used to fit a time-varying contact matrix which can track changes in mobility.

The default distribution of houses according to the number of inhabitants is given by a vector of probabilities pH for which the probability of a house to have i members is given by the i-th entry of this vector. Houses with more than 5 individuals are not included in the model, i.e., we assume pH is of dimension 5. 

In the experiments, we assumed the cumulative confirmed cases for each location is observed, which is defined as the sum of IM, IS, H, R, D for each neighborhood.

Time varying number of contacts. In this experiment, the number of contacts an agent has in a day, which is encoded in λ, is considered to decrease linearly in time in the true simulation. This parameter is assumed unknown for the method and is estimated through state augmentation. 

The initial prior mean parameters and state variables are chosen different from the true values because they are assumed to be unknown. Besides, the variance of the initial ensemble is chosen to be large as is standard in DA in order to better explore the parameter space. Initial parameter correlations are set to 0. As the observations are assimilated the ensemble starts to improve the prior state and it slowly synchronizes with the true value. 

At each simulation day, we select a random set of agents and test them. Tests will be positive when the agent is in either IM, IS, IA, or H. The tests are not disaggregated by location, so they give an idea of the global circulation of the virus. The error for the observations of the global positivity will be sampling error. We assume 1% of the population is tested every day.

We estimate the parameter λ (which is assumed to be the same for every neighborhood) through state augmentation.

Limitations

The study is affected by several limitations. First, the synthetic population used in the study accounts for the repartition of contacts across workplaces, schools, households, etc., informed by contact surveys. However, number of contacts and risk of transmission may vary greatly according to the kind of occupation. The synthetic population accounts for this variability assuming that the average number of contacts from one workplace to another is gamma distributed 10, but no data were available to inform the model in this respect. Second, we model vaccination uptake according to age only, when it is determined by several socio-demographic factors. Clusters of vaccine-hesitant individuals may play an important role in the dynamics and facilitate the epidemic persistence in the population, as it is described for measles 56. In those countries where vaccination coverage is high, heterogeneities in attitude toward vaccination may have an impact. Third, the agent-based model is calibrated from French socio-demographic data. The results of this study can be extended to countries with similar societal structure and contact patterns, e.g. other developed countries 57. Still, COVID-19 transmission potential, level of disease-induced immunity, vaccination coverage, and extent of social restrictions vary substantially from one country to another. In addition, the waning of immunity since vaccination and recommendations for booster doses affect the level of protection of the population already vaccinated and consequently the impact of reactive vaccination. The large set of scenarios explored and reported in the Supplementary Information is intended to fully understand the interplay between epidemic spread and reactive vaccination and aid planning in case of future epidemic surges.",Yes,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5910314,Yes,"We extended a previously described SARS-CoV-2 transmission model [10] to simulate vaccine administration alongside other interventions—i.e. contact tracing, teleworking and social restrictions.

",Yes,"Among the three strategies, the reduction produced by mass vaccination was slightly lower. This is because the strategies are compared at the same number of daily vaccine doses and, in workplaces/universities and school locations, these doses were directed to a more active population—working population, or population living in large households—with a greater potential to transmit the infection.

Fig. 2 Comparison between vaccination strategies

The four strategies are compared at equal numbers of vaccine doses. The baseline epidemic scenario of panels a–h is defined by the following key parameters: R = 1.6; VES,1 = 48%, VESP,1 = 53%, VES,2 = 70%, VESP,2 = 73%; initial immunity 32%; initial incidence 160 clinical cases weekly per 100,000 inhabitants; 90% of 60+ vaccinated at the beginning. i AR RR for different vaccine effectiveness levels, assuming intermediate vaccination coverage (40% of adults) and all other parameters as in panels a–h. The baseline vaccine effectiveness values used in the other panels is compared with a worst and a best-case scenario, defined respectively by VES,1 = 30%, VESP,1 = 35%, VES,2 = 53%, VESP,2 = 60%, and by VES,1 = 65%, VESP,1 = 75%, VES,2 = 80%, VESP,2 = 95%. For each vaccine effectiveness scenario the four strategies are compared at equal numbers of vaccine doses. In panels a, d, f, g, i,

Indeed, the proportion of unvaccinated people attending workplaces/schools that are targeted by vaccination is lower and fewer vaccine doses are administered, leading to a smaller impact at the population level (Fig. 2d). Still, reactive vaccination produced a 13% reduction in the attack rate using ~250 doses per 100,000 inhabitants each day on average, when the same reduction required ~400 doses per 100,000 inhabitants each day with non-reactive strategies. The impact of reactive vaccination finally became very small when initial vaccination coverage was high. Figure 2g, h shows a scenario where 65% of the [12,60] group and 90% of 60+ is vaccinated at the beginning, corresponding to ~60% of the whole population close to the coverage reached in Europe in the Fall 20211. Only 94 daily vaccines per 100,000 inhabitants were used each day with a 5% reduction in the attack rate compared to a 3% reduction with non-reactive strategies for an equal number of doses. Non-reactive strategies with vaccination pace higher or equal to 300 doses per 100,000 inhabitants each day yielded a higher reduction in cases (~8% or higher)

In Fig. 4 we compare the combined scenario with mass vaccination alone at an equal number of doses and investigate starting reactive vaccination after 1, 5 or 10 detected cases. With reactive vaccination starting from the first detected case, the attack rate decreased by ~10%, compared with the mass scenario. However, the added value of reactive vaccination decreased if the start of the intervention was delayed. Without enhancement in TTI and increase in vaccine uptake, attack-rate values were much higher and the benefit of reactive vaccination over the mass vaccination was lower (~3%)


Importantly, the effectiveness of the reactive strategy depends on the epidemic context. We found that the higher the overall vaccination coverage, the less reactive vaccination would be of interest compared to non-reactive strategies if it did not increase vaccine uptake. For example, with >40% vaccination coverage among adults, the relative reduction in attack rates with reactive vaccination is smaller than with non-reactive alternatives provided large enough vaccination pace and no increase in vaccine uptake with reactive vaccination. Indeed, with large vaccination coverage, only a few individuals who have not been vaccinated before can be reactively proposed for vaccination, leading to few shots in case of vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, the detection of clusters is more difficult in a highly vaccinated population, where breakthrough infections in the vaccinated yield a large proportion of subclinical cases that are harder to detect.

The second method, “CONTACT-TARGET”, follows the strategy described in Cohen & Havlin (2010), whereby each day by random agents are sampled who each select one random contact (without replacement) for intervention. Because of the friendship paradox (Feld 1991)

On day 1, b random agents are sampled from among all agents. For each sampled node a random network neighbor is sampled.

On day 1, the b nodes with the b highest degrees are selected and immunized; on day 2, the b nodes with degree rank b + 1 through 2b are targeted, and so on",Get vaccinated; General preventative behavior,"We considered three methods for selecting agents for intervention. The first method, “NO-TARGET”, simply ran-
domly samples b agents for intervention each day and is intended as a benchmark against which to contrast the
other two methods. This method corresponds to what Pastor-Satorras & Vespignani (2002) refer to as “uniform
intervention.”
3.20 The second method, “CONTACT-TARGET”,follows the strategy described in Cohen & Havlin (2010), whereby each
day b random agents are sampled who each select one random contact (without replacement) for intervention.
Because of the friendship paradox (Feld 1991), these targets have above-average expected degree (Christakis
& Fowler 2010). This is so because high-degree nodes are by definition overrepresented among other nodes’
contacts (Feld 1991). The CONTACT-TARGET strategy is implementable in practice as a government could in fact
randomly sample from the known population and have sampled individuals suggest their contacts. This was
implemented as follows: On day 1, b random agents are sampled from among all agents. For each sampled node
a random network neighbor is sampled. The intervention is targeted at these b random neighbors. On day 2,
again b random nodes are sampled. For each sampled node a random network neighbor is sampled who had
not previously been intervened on. The intervention is targeted at these b random neighbors, and so on6.
3.21 The third method, “HUB-TARGET”, assumes that agents’ numbers of contacts were perfectly observed. During
each iteration, nodes are targeted in strictly decreasing order of their network degree, starting with the b largest
hubs. This was implemented as follows: On day 1, the b nodes with the b highest degrees are selected and
immunized; on day 2, the b nodes with degree rank b + 1 through 2b are targeted, and so on",No,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,,Yes,NetLogo,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"It draws attention to one limitation of contact-diary based data collection.

For this reason, we adopted a conservative approach and based the calibration of the synthetic network underlying our main analysis on diary-based contacts only (see Figure 1’s leplot). In the Appendix C, however, we re-ran all analyses under a combination of diary-based contacts and job-related extra contacts in such a way that a fixed transmission probability assumption is still defensible.

The dyadic, meaning agentto-agent, transmission probability r was assumed to be normally distributed with mean equal to 0.03, 0.05 or 0.07, and standard-deviation equal to 0.023.

We assumed a government with a fixed daily (medical / technological / financial / ethical) capacity to intervene on b individuals.

The third method, “HUB-TARGET”, assumes that agents’ numbers of contacts were perfectly observed.

Figure 4 shows the impact of the three intervention methods on viral diffusion in the DC network with low clustering, assuming an intermediate dyadic transmission probability.

Panels B show results for the CONTACT-TARGET procedure, which assumes that no global information on connectivity is available.

Panels A, B, and C again represent results for the three intervention methods separately, again assuming an intermediate dyadic transmission probability (r = 0.05).

In the Appendix B, we further explored the robustness of our results under different assumptions on transmission probabilities and clustering (see in particular, Figure 11-16).

In our simulations, this method was reasonably effective yet at the same time was conservative in assuming no knowledge of degree or use thereof.

However, the configuration model is known to be able to generate only a limited degree of clustering, which is constrained within this model by the imposed degree distribution and network size (Newman 2003, p. 202).

Our study has several limitations. First, the recommendation of prioritization of hubs in interventions is based on an assessment of effects on overall containment.

Second, our model is silent on the specific content of the actions to be performed on each finally selected individual.

Third, our simulation models varied only heterogeneity in the number of close-range contacts across individuals and levels of clustering.

Finally, a factor that could limit the super’spreader status of hubs and the effectiveness of hub targeting is contact time, namely if contact time were inversely proportional to the number of contacts.

The detailed formulation of our model and its algorithmic implementation is provided in appendix A (electronic supplementary material, SOF), with references to relevant equations in this provided in table 1. In a nutshell we:

7. Assumed that agent Ai can be infectious at time t with at most one dominant variant (denoted by the index j), although due to mutational processes this agent may infect other agents with variants related to this dominant variant at much lower rates (i.e.through application of a mutation factor μ ≪ 1, applied in our basic model through electronic supplementary material, equation (A.13)).

8. Assumed that agent Ai will have different levels of waning immunity to all of the variants to which it has been infected in the past.

14. Assumed that waning and cross-immunity to a particular variant is the same for both natural infections and vaccinations that use the antigen associated with that variant (of course we can easily extend our model to remove this assumption once data become available to support different waning and cross-immunity rates for natural infections and particular vaccines).

Thus, for example, in our multivariant simulations, we have assumed that all variants are shed at the same relative rate (i.e. ζij = 1 for relevant i and j = 0, …, 2J− 1), have the same environmental persistence properties (i.e. ηℓ = 1 for all ℓ = 0, …, 2J− 1), the same within host replication rates (i.e. λℓ0 = 1 for all ℓ0 = 0, …, 2J− 1), and are all equally virulent (i.e. αj = α for all j = 0, …, 2J− 1). Obviously, these assumptions can be relaxed once suitable data are available for a particular pathogen to support variant specific shedding, persistence, within-host replication and virulence values.

Limitations: (implied)

Beyond these elaborations, structure can be added to address other salient issues. One such issue would be to obtain a better understanding of the role informational delays may play in producing the type of incidence waves that have been observed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic (and as we have modelled in [44]). Such delays would lead to contact rates containing a time-lag rather than depending only on current prevalence levels. We might also spend more time deconstructing the relative importance of such time delays versus the emergence of more transmissible variants in accounting for these waves.

Making our model both location- and variant-specific could be undertaken using methods, such as appropriate complexity modelling [13,14], designed to enhance the relevance of models. Furthermore, in some cases, it may be useful to add spatial or age-structure information to our M-SEIR or include a contact network [7], which itself may contain spatial or refined class category (e.g. age or work categories) information. In addition, our current implementation represents variant differences in terms of J loci with two alleles (denoted by 0 and 1, respectively) at each locus. A more realistic representation of the genetic basis of variant differences may involve genetic representations in which several alleles are possible at each locus. Furthermore, the loci themselves may represent relevant molecular structures such as epitopes.",Yes,https://github.com/rmsalter/SEIVAgent_distribution,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Geosciences Atmospheric Sciences and Ocean Sciences, Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Industry","Computer science, Health Sciences, Mathematics (general), Environmental Science","Department ESPM, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720-3114, USA

All immunity from infection is assumed to be sterilizing immunity which prevents re-infection (i.e. not just reduction in symptoms or severity).

Under the additional assumption that all cross-population interactions occur between random people in each domain, it can be shown (see electronic supplementary material) that the expected number of transmissions in domain n from domain m is E(infected in n from m on t) ≈ S¯ n(t)αφm,n ! km k=1 G(k)Im(t − k), where S¯ n is the mean susceptibility of individuals in domain n, α is a measure of the strength of cross-border interactions, φm,n is the total number of cross-border interactions between the domains normalized by the population in domain m, G(k) is the generation-time distribution and Im(t) is the number of infections in domain m at time t. This is implemented in the meta-population model by calculating the expected number of people who would be infected in each domain if the entire population were susceptible, and then challenging that number of individuals randomly selected from the population (those with immunity will not be infected)

Relative to earlier variants, the transmissibility of B.1.177 is estimated to have increased by 1.14 (1.12–1.16) and that of Alpha by 1.71 (1.65–1.77).

As a test of the robustness of the ABM and the parameter estimation method, we estimated the relative transmissibility of different viral variants using both the ABM and a simple renewal-equation model, which had a small number of parameters for which posterior distributions could be calculated

Posterior distributions for key parameters, such as variant transmissibility, were estimated using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), with the estimates of the renewal equation model informing the priors.

Finally, we used an observation model to link the observed number of cases to the expected number estimated by the infection model Ci(t) = NegBinomial(E(Ci(t)), φOD), where φOD is the over-dispersion parameter.

A meta-analysis of six studies of the efficacy of mask wearing estimated that it reduces incidence by 25–71% [42]. During the period of study, mask wearing in England on public transport and in shops was mandated, and over 95% of individuals surveyed reported wearing a mask at some time [43], although not in classrooms or workplaces. Therefore, we used the lower end of the meta-analysis range and modelled the overall effect as a 25% reduction in transmission rates on all non-household networks. UK survey estimates in January 2021 for duration-weighted adherence to self-isolation were 40.8–62.8% [44]; therefore 60% of people were assumed to isolate at home upon developing symptoms, with a 2% daily drop-out. The reduction in mobility from the Google mobility data was not sufficient to explain the reduction in infections during the nationwide lockdowns in November 2020 and January 2021, possibly because of other changes in behaviour such as reduced socializing. Therefore, an extra factor to reduce non-household contacts during these lockdowns was applied equally to all regions and was estimated in the calibration

The baseline OpenABM-Covid19 parameters were used in each of the English UTLA regions with the population scaled by 20% [26]. The additional 18 new parameters for the meta population model were estimated using ABC [45,46]. Flat range priors were set on each parameter (see electronic supplementary material) and 2000 parameter sets were sampled from the prior using Latin hypercube sampling [47,48]. Five stochastic replicate runs of the model were generated for each parameter set and summary statistics were calculated for seven features (see electronic supplementary material). The top 25 parameter sets were then used to seed 25 chains and sequential ABC was performed (see electronic supplementary material). The posterior distribution for the time series of cases and deaths was taken from all the stochastic replicates of these parameter sets.

The transmissibility of the B.1.177 and Alpha lineages relative to the wild-type lineages was first estimated by fitting the renewal-equation model to weekly cases by lineage. The transmissibility of the B.1.177 variant relative to the wild-type lineages was estimated as 1.14 (credible interval 1.12–1.16), suggesting that only a modest increase in fitness was sufficient for it to grow dramatically relative to the wild-type lineages over this period (electronic supplementary material, figure 1a). The fraction of the B.1.177 lineage relative to wild-type lineages in England continued to increase for four months after the initial seeding events (until the sweep of the Alpha variant), suggesting that the increase cannot be understood purely in terms of seeding one specific age group. The transmissibility of the Alpha variant relative to the wild-type lineages was estimated as 1.71 (1.65–1.77; electronic supplementary material, figure 1b) and as 1.51 (1.44–1.54; electronic supplementary material, figure 1c) relative to B.1.177, which is consistent with previous estimates using other methods (1.43–1.90 [5] and 1.5–2.0 [4], both defined relative to the mixed population of other contemporaneous lineages). The posterior distribution of the wild-type reproduction number and overall reproduction number are shown in the electronic supplementary material, figure 1d"

Sections 1-3 assume that covid-19 vaccines prevent both symptoms of infection and transmission of virus (sterilizing vaccine), whereas section 4 examines the possibility that vaccines prevent only symptoms and not asymptomatic infection and spread (non-sterilizing vaccine). All simulations assume an efficacy of two vaccine doses of 95%. A simulation using a 90% estimate for the vaccine efficacy after two doses can be found in the supplementary material (appendix 2).

To model single dose efficacy, we assumed no protection against covid-19 infection for the first 12 days after the initial dose and thereafter a protection of 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, or 50% that persists for the remainder of our 180 day simulation.

Assuming that cases in the vaccine and control groups follow two different Poisson random distributions, on the basis of the trial data the 95% confidence interval for the rate ratio between them (which corresponds to the vaccine effectiveness) is 66% to 96%. 

This suggests that the delayed second dose except for 65+ strategy is optimal or close to optimal assuming a conservative first dose efficacy of 80% and for vaccination rates at or below 1% population per day.

As a simulation study, our study has several limitations based on the assumptions used in the model. Firstly, we used a range of estimates for single dose vaccine efficacy based on the CDC’s estimates and our own analysis, but the true efficacy may fall outside of those ranges. Secondly, we did not include immune decay in our model. 

Thirdly, several assumptions about the infectious spread (for example, the rate of contact between individuals in work, family, and random environments or the likelihood of infection during a random contact) 
were incorporated into the model, which seemed to match observations at the time the model was run, but these assumptions may not hold in all environments or if circumstances change.

Finally, our study did not measure the effect of mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 and various infectivity rates, or differences in behavior geographically, or the impact of other preventive measures such as digital exposure notification or availability and turnaround times of testing that vary between states and between countries.2

We introduced several elements of novelty with respect to state of the art on ABM, including i) different testing strategies in hospitals and drivethroughs; ii) time variations in testing prevalence; iii) multiple types of treatment, from home isolation to hospitalization in an ICU; iv) the presence of susceptible agents who have COVID19-like symptoms due to other infections; v) explicit modeling of employees of hospitals, schools, and retirement homes; vi) school and business closures and reopenings; vii) comprehensive model calibration with officially reported data; and viii) incorporation of expert knowledge from the field.",Propose framework,Framework for modeling disease in a specific location or setting,Yes,"Decision-making by public authorities could benefit from the model, for its fine-grain resolution, open-source nature, and wide range of features.

Beyond the timely study of vaccination strategies, our model can be adapted to explore a range of pressing problems that are ahead of us by interested users who can directly modify our open-source platform. For example, the model can be swiftly adapted to describe the concurrent spread of influenza with COVID-19, which is expected to exacerbate the impact of second and third waves.

Exposed agents and agents showing symptoms —whether from COVID-19 or another condition— have the possibility of being tested which can be performed either in a hospital (THs) or a car (TC)

After testing, agents are assigned treatment from one of the following three treatment types: home isolation (IHm), routine hospitalization (HN), and hospitalization in an ICU (HICU).

To simulate realistic COVID-19 epidemic conditions, we introduce school closures, a state-wide lockdown, and the three reopening phases I, II, and III.

Hospitalization duration in the model is derived from the literature,[22] and linearly scaled by a factor of 0.39 according to the data in the paper by Richardson et al.[49] which are specific to the geographic region considered in this work. Specifically, the study by Richardson et al.[49] provides actual hospitalization duration in New York City, though without distinguishing between ICU and non-ICU treatment, and relative lengths of these two. Hence, we use the ratio of the total hospital treatment duration reported in Richardson et al.[49] and Ferguson et al.[22] to obtain locally realistic hospitalization periods.

(13 results)

We assume that the town is isolated, such that the agents cannot leave the town, and new agents cannot enter during the simulation.

We assume that this population is constant throughout the duration of the simulation.

Following the COVID-19 infectiousness profile, we assume that exposed agents are not infectious during the initial part of the latency period. When the latency period is over, exposed agents develop symptoms and become infectious-symptomatic (Sy).[4]

We assume that drive-through testing does not carry the risk of infection based on the work of Upham.[34]

We assume that the test is performed for a fixed amount of time after the decision to be tested, and similarly that the result of a test appears after a fixed delay following the test.

At the beginning of the simulation, we initialize the entire population as susceptible, assuming no prior immunity in a virtually COVID-19-free population. 

Assuming that asymptomatic agents do not die, we can compute the overall time-averaged probability that a symptomatic agent dies by re-scaling the IFR by the probability of developing symptoms once contracting COVID-19

We assume that the probability of getting a false negative among COVID-19-infected symptomatic agents when the epidemic prevalence is low is negligible.[56,57] We can then approximate the probability of a true negative by the probability of receiving a negative result.

Parameters, data sources, and assumptions are listed and indicated in Section S2, Supporting Information.

The number of deaths includes both treated and undetected, untreated agents, assuming that COVID-19 would be confirmed in individuals who have died, regardless of their testing status. 

Assumptions (implied)

A symptomatic agent who is untested will not undergo treatment, and their removal is determined following similar rules to the tested agents. However, an untested agent requiring ICU treatment has an increased probability of dying, to account for the higher mortality in the absence of a diagnosis. 

Testing is performed differently for exposed hospital employees and patients originally admitted for non-COVID-19-related diagnosis (such as a car accident or cancer treatment). These agents do not undergo home isolation, and their testing is always performed in the hospitals they work or reside in, without the option of a test car. The symptomatic hospital staff is home isolated prior to receiving the test results, while the non-COVID-19 patients stay in the hospital and, upon developing COVID-19 symptoms, they are counted among hospitalized COVID-19 cases.

Limitations

While undoubtedly useful, our model bears several limitations. First, the model lacks explicit agent mobility and random contacts, which manifest in a faster decline of the epidemic near the end of the simulation. The original model by Ferguson et al.[19,20], serving as the basis for our own, had an additional term to the model disease spreading through random contacts in the community. However, these contacts were based on commute and travel data at the level of the entire country, which is not directly applicable to the problem at hand of a small town. Simulating truly random interactions using a contact network approach similar to Hinch et al.[24] may offer an alternative, which will be part of our future work. Along these lines, the impact of local travel and commute can further be included in the model by integrating traffic flow simulations.[63–65]

In addition to mobility and random contacts, our model does not include testing the general population, leading to possible under-detection of cases in later reopening stages. While the model allows for testing uninfected individuals with symptoms, massive community testing is needed to align its outcomes with reality in later phases of the epidemic. Testing of general population along with random interactions is also expected to highlight the effects of different testing strategies already encoded within the model. Combined with contact tracing options, testing of general population is part of the next step in our platform’s development.

Another limitation of our approach is in the modeling of hospitals in terms of their workforce and capacity. Specifically, we assume that infections of hospital employees do not trigger changes in the treatment of hospital patients and that hospitals have infinite beds and ICUs. Finally, we do not explicitly account for the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs), such as face coverings, and social distancing of agents. While these measures are included indirectly through reduction of disease transmission during the lock-down and reopening phases, the ability of specific agents to protect themselves from the contagion would improve the granularity of the model and add a further realistic element, at the expenses of the computational burden. Advantageous impact of PPEs and distancing can be introduced to both susceptible and infected agents in a similar way to agent’s current infectiousness variability, and this will be one of our goals in the nearest future.

Limitations (implied)

Looking closely, however, the model has a smooth progression of the disease compared to a sudden high number of initial cases in the real data. We note that our model imparts a simplistic scenario of the testing practice, whereby an aggressive contact tracing followed the town’s initial case detection.[60] This likely resulted in a large difference in the number of initial cases in our model versus the real data. Simulating this particular scenario is currently outside the scope of our model.",Yes,https://github.com/Dynamical-Systems-Laboratory/NR-ABM-population,Yes,"The model is based on the earlier ABM developed by Ferguson’s research group to study pandemic influenza,[19–21] which has been recently adapted to study COVID-19.[22]

To govern the contact behavior, we use the class and teaching schedule to place individuals in specific classes at scheduled times, respectively. In each class, the contacts between students and between students and faculty are then governed by certain contact rates .

For instance, if individuals would comply with the social distancing precaution (X1 = 1), and the 6-foot distance is fully effective, v = 1, (e.g. the individuals can escape from infection if they keep 6 feet away from each other even without other interventions), then the transmission probability is zero. In contrast, if v = 0.9 (e.g. there remains 10% chance that the individuals cannot escape from infection even the 6-foot distance is kept), then the transmission probability equals to 1 – e –b(1–v)t , a real number between 0 and 1, when neither masks nor vaccines are used. Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine whether an infection event occurs or not eventually

The use of masks is a mandatory requirement in many universities; therefore, we focus on examining the effectiveness of mask protection given a particular mask type, e.g. surgical, cloth mask",Get vaccinated; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft),"Of particular interest, we focus on four disease mitigation interventions: (1) course modality shift, (2) social distancing, (3) mask use and (4) vaccination.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,No,AnyLogic,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Here, we assume that all the individuals are in compliance with the social distancing precaution while the effectiveness of the 6-foot distance is 0.9.

Fortunately, the agent-based model used in this study simulated encounters and transmissions between individuals; thus, it may be extended to include any selection of individual characteristics. Furthermore, as the simulation can be run with a large number of individuals (more than a million), it may represent various comorbidities, living, habits, or other conditions within a given population.

We assumed that the transmission network is built upon a pre-generated weighted social connection network. 

Here, ni should be less than the number of connections (i.e. the number of acquaintances that one can have), and thus, the ith node was assumed to have a connection with γ1ni acquaintances.

Infection risk may associate with age [12, 13]. Thus, we assumed an age-specific susceptibility ðsj) (see in the Supplementary Material, Figure S1) according to a previous study [12] and a time-dependent rate of transmissibility (T) from symptom [8] (i.e. transmissibility changes in infectious period and peaks at symptom onset; see Table S3 in the Supplementary Material).

A node during the infectious state is assumed to transfer to the removed state after the end of the removed period.

Our study has limitations. Transmission directions within networks were mostly based on symptom onset. Although this methodology has been widely used in other studies [8, 38, 44], there is potential for misclassification, leading to the reversal of several transmission pathways.

Contacts between the patients and the dialysis staff can be loci of infectious spread. The probability of virus transmission is a function of the number of contacts, average contact duration, and the distance of the subject with the substance [28]. To model disease spread, we
recorded agent movements and created contact matrices that include this information. The contact matrix is one of the mathematical components used for disease modelling among different groups of individuals in an environment.

We assumed that for non working persons, the public places they visit are mainly outpatient clinics, convenience stores, and shopping centers where transmission of infection from carriers to healthy person can occur.

We assumed this trend early in the pandemic when the risk of reinfection was low [48].

The parameter can be physically understood as follows: assuming a homogeneously mixed population, a randomly chosen susceptible person has c contacts per unit time with other persons, and p is the probability of disease transmission from an infected person to a susceptible person.

In this scenario, we assumed that the population was vaccinated with Gam-COVID Vac at an average rate of 0.003%, which corresponds to the actual vaccination rate in Kazakhstan [66]. 

4.2. Limitation 

This study had some limitations. Our model could not reflect the diversity of human activity inherent in real life. For simplicity, we assumed that people travel to at most one place each day (for students and workers, public transport is an intermediate link) and spend a certain amount of time there, which varies between places and age groups. The scenarios considered were idealized; for example, schools allowed special classes for graduates, vaccination rates were uneven, and mask compliance was difficult to assess. All of this may lead to underestimations of the number of agent contacts and the rate of infection. 

Some model parameters derived from previously published studies varied across studies. For example, we adopted the incubation period as 6 days. However, different authors have suggested an incubation period of COVID-19 from 3 to 11 days. A longer incubation period leads to a later onset of symptoms and the isolation of the patient, which in turn increases the number of people in contact with him. Therefore, we averaged the data to avoid potential inaccuracies in our model. In our model, we assumed that after symptoms of the disease appear, people are immediately isolated, and those who have recovered from COVID-19 cannot be reinfected throughout the entire epidemic period. However, evidence to support this assumption is limited. 

Moreover, we did not take into account that different segments of the population have different susceptibilities to infection. As a result, we received underestimated morbidity data among older people and overestimated data among young people. Nevertheless, these shortcomings do not detract from the significance of the results obtained. Despite these limitations, our model matched real data very closely, as was shown in Section 3.1.",No,https://cloud.anylogic.com/model/ba844cef-a41f-4032-8e1f-517e243b8e5f?mode=SETTINGS ,Yes,"We used the COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (COVID-ESFT, version 2.0) to generate a forecast model of the healthcare resources needed [67].",One discipline,Mathematics and Statistics,Statistics,"Department of Informatics and Biostatistics, Karaganda Medical University, Gogol St. 40, Karaganda 100008, Kazakhstan

Thus, it constitutes a considerable problem for efficient combat with the virus spreading [19, 37–39]. The problem is increasingly more scientifically interesting in the third-wave epidemics because the virus circulates among a large fraction of the population. Hence, a better understanding of the factors that determine the proportion of the asymptomatic virus carries in a given social environment, and their impact on the overall infection growth is vital for managing the disease outbreak. In this work, we tackle these problems using the microscopic dynamics approach within the agent-based modelling framework developed in Ref. [1]. 

We have studied the microscopic dynamics modelling of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics by building on the modelling framework developed in Ref. [1]. By keeping information about the host that produces a virus implicated in an infection event, we have been able to disentangle the cases attributed to asymptomatic from those caused by presymptomatic virus carriers.

The social participation activity drives the dynamics; as a good proxy, we use an empirical time series st inferred from social networks [48]. In analogy to the time series of the human mobility within cities [44, 49], this time series represents a cu­mulative activity of an open social group in an area with circulating viruses. Thus, it does not assume any prior relationships among partic­ipants (see also the Discussion section). 

Assumptions (implied)

After developing symptoms within an in­dividual time interval of rih ∈ [2, 7] days, each symptomatic agent is hospitalised or quarantined and removed from the process. Whereas, each asymptomatic agent stays in the process until its spontaneous re­covery after rs days (equal to all agents).

At present, we do not consider different variants of the virus; thus, a unique survival time Tv applies as a parameter. Here, we also do not consider potential mutations along the infection path.

All simulations included contact tracing (assuming no limit on the number of contacts traceable per day), testing, and an assumed near-perfect effectiveness of both domestic self-isolation and quarantine on every network except the home network (see electronic supplementary material, table S5).

COVASIM’s default assumption is that the transmissibility of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases is the same. This assumption is based on the results presented by He et al. [46], where they did not find a statistically significant difference between transmissibility in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. 

We used this same assumption for our simulations with the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants.

This vaccine model makes the additional assumption that people who are vaccinated and become infected will be 100% protected from symptomatic disease, meaning that they will no longer develop symptoms (both mild and severe) or progress into critical states and death (see electronic supplementary material, table S7). Another simplifying assumption of this model is that it does not explicitly model the reduction of onward transmission [50–52]. 

Naive individuals are assumed to have no protective NAbs against SARS-CoV-2.

The key assumptions underlying NAb kinetics are the following: NAbs grow linearly until they reach their peak after three weeks and then follow a two-part exponential decay, with a 100-day half-life in the first 250 days and an exponentially decaying decay rate until a 10-year half-life is achieved [31,53]. The implementation in COVASIM allows for customization of the functional form of the immunity kinetics, but because this is not the main focus of the present work, we assume that all individuals have the same kinetics for naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity.

These results show that herd immunity may be achieved against Alpha for a vaccine coverage as low as around 40% of the eligible population (approx. 34% of the total population), assuming a vaccine effectiveness of at least 90%.

This is because this simplified vaccine model assumes perfect protection against symptomatic disease, which interacts with differential testing rates for asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.

We asked whether the observed fluctuations in age-specific hesitancy levels in Australia (figure 3) would have a significant effect on health outcomes, assuming that these hesitant proportions represent the final unvaccinated populations.

Agents aged 12–16 were assigned the same hesitancy as the 3544 age group, which we assumed to be their parents (figure 7c).

The results from our scenarios with Delta and Omicron, an eligible population encompassing the total population and vaccine effectiveness above 80% are consistent with estimates from earlier modelling work [64,65], where herd immunity thresholds sit at 60–70% of the total population, assuming vaccines are delivered at random and (naive) individuals mix at random.

Assuming that vaccination provides, on average, an effectiveness of 90% against infection—which is at the upper end of observed effectiveness [42,68]—extension of the vaccination programme to children seems essential.

Limitations
One limitation of this study is that we have not sought to model the roll-out trajectory itself, instead opting for the simpler case of examining the situation once the roll-out stalls upon vaccinating all of the (currently projected) willing members of the population. 

We also simplified the mix of vaccines, modelling scenarios that assumed an overall level of vaccine effectiveness averaged across vaccine brands, as well as optimistic scenarios where all agents were vaccinated with Pfizer–BioNTech, whose effectiveness may be overestimated with respect to Omicron.

Another simplification in our scenarios was the assumption that only one variant was circulating at any time, rather than a mix of multiple variants. At the time this work was carried out, our assumption was supported by earlier modelling studies which had shown that in settings like Queensland with near-zero prior naturally acquired immunity and no countermeasures in place, a more transmissible variant (like Omicron) rapidly outcompetes a less transmissible variant (like Delta) [30,31,58]. This assumption was confirmed by the Omicron wave experienced in Queensland in January 2022.

Other limitations that would likely affect the transmission dynamics include our assumption that TTIQ effectiveness does not reduce over time, which would reflect ‘fatigue’ with restrictions in the community as well as the rolling back of such interventions (and indeed as of May 2022 contact tracing has largely ended in Queensland and close contacts no longer need to isolate in most cases). We also do not model seasonal or day-of-the-week effects on contact networks.

In this work, we have analysed the level of vaccine coverage and effectiveness to achieve herd immunity in a population with low natural immunity, and while our model has been customized to the population of Queensland and incorporates a high degree of population heterogeneity (e.g. age-specific prognoses and immunity properties [63]), there were many simplifying assumptions made in Case 1a discussed in §3, including the lack of an explicit reduction in onward transmission.",Yes,https://github.com/brain-modelling-group/paper-covid-herd-hesitancy,Yes,CovaSim,Two different disciplines,"Mathematics and Statistics, Industry",Mathematics (general),"Brain Modelling Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD 4006, Australia

UTLDR is designed to be easy to use and capable to leverage information provided by stratified populations of agents (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns...). Moreover, the proposed framework is generic and not tailored for a specific epidemic phenomena: it aims to provide a qualitative support to understanding the effects of restrictions, rather than produce forecasts/explanation of specific data-driven phenomena.

Conversely, from recent studies, our aim is not to describe a specific model but to allow UTLDR users to define their own.

A challenge for any model of travel and mixing heterogeneity is to parameterize the model properly.

Automatically collected travel data from mobile devices, as well as other sources of place-visit data more generally, can be a promising way to approach these challenges [24, 31]. In order to use this type of data in our model, one would need to add the parameters determining travel behavior to Eq. 4.

Testing and detection of symptomatic cases already in self-quarantine is assumed to be more effective, and their daily probability of detection PDSQ is set to 0.8. The model assumes that all severe cases are tested and detected on admission to hospital.

In the Victorian second wave, contact tracing by itself was insufficient to stop growth in infections and a severe lockdown was eventually imposed. We reproduced this fact in the model suite by assuming that a proportion PU of infected cases were permanently undetected and untraceable.

The Australia-wide tracing capacity TCAP is assumed to be between 100 and 500 daily detected cases but we note that in specific jurisdictions, such as Victoria during its second wave, the capacity could have been below 100 new daily cases, in the absence of end-to-end automated process for enabling and recording contact tracing (Legal and Social Issues Committee 2020).

Positive overseas arrivals in quarantine are assumed to be detected immediately upon displaying symptoms and are represented in the model as new infectives appearing TS days before being reported. Reported overseas cases are assumed to be accompanied by additional undetected asymptomatic cases, in the ratio PA:1–PA.

Individuals have different transmission rates, depending on their status. Cases in the asymptomatic category are assumed to have a mean transmission rate equal to FA times that of those in the symptomatic category. While there should be zero transmission from cases in self-isolation or self-quarantine, in practice some transmission occurs. The model suite assumes the transmission rate from those in self-quarantine or self-isolation is reduced by the ‘leakage’ factor PL.

Hotel quarantine was initially assumed to be 100% effective in preventing transmission. However, cases of transmission from within hotel quarantine contributed to Victoria’s second wave, and multiple other cases of transmission from within hotel quarantine have been observed since in Australia. Accordingly, the model allows the generation of community infected cases from within hotel quarantine with a (very low) daily probability PQ.

All the models used in this study assume homogeneous mixing of infected with a susceptible pool of size SUS. The number of susceptible people, POP, is initially set to 20 million, assuming approximately 80% of the Australian population was initially susceptible. 

These scenarios assume highly effective border controls and quarantine for all new arrivals into Australia and PQ is set to zero. Social distancing is not relaxed until there is no recorded community transmission. Thus, each of the six scenarios in Table 2 assumes the goal is to achieve no community transmission.

Limitations

Limitations of this study
Our model suite does not allow us to fully capture the differences in transmission across multiple communities or sub-populations as would an agent-based model. Such transmission differences may arise from multiple factors, including cultural reasons, housing density, and the proportion of workers who are in the casual workforce and who may have financial incentives not to be tested or go to work sick. The relationship between hidden transmission and essential workers, not accounted for in our modelling, is relevant for the effectiveness of social distancing. This is because, depending on the stringency of social distancing measures, workers may still be able to infect their workmates at their workplaces. In recognition of this incentive problem, supplementary payments of A$1500 were provided to Victorian workers from 20 June 2020 who tested positive or who were a close contact to someone who tested positive, and from 13 August, A$450 was provided to those who were in self-isolation awaiting test results.",Yes,https://osf.io/2r9h6/,No,"(no model name/citation clearly indicated)

A simple sample importance resample (SIR) procedure was used to obtain the posterior distribution of parameters. An ensemble of 200,000 simulations was generated, using independent random samples from the prior parameter distribution (the prior was treated as uniform on the parameter ranges specified in Table 1, and parameters were treated as independent in the prior). Because of the large ensemble size, the DCM was used as a fast approximation to the SCM in this procedure. Comparison of posterior ensembles from the SCM and DCM suggested this provided a good approximation to the posterior parameter distribution for both models.

2.1 Agent-based simulation model

A proportion of susceptible and recovered individuals receive the first shot of the vaccine. The individuals who choose the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines receive the second shot after a few weeks of their first shot. The susceptible people who have received the vaccine can still be infected, but their probability of infection is much smaller than the general susceptible population. Given a 90-day planning period, we assume that the recovered individuals do not get infected again.

2.2 Optimization model formulation
This section provides the essential features and assumptions of the optimization model, the associated notations, and the mathematical formulation.

2.2.1 Important features and model assumptions

Since the majority of unnoticed cases are non-severe or asymptomatic, we assume that those would not cause a heavy burden on the healthcare systems. Therefore, we do not adjust the estimation of infections in regard to unbiased estimations.

Limitations

The limitations of the optimization and simulation models and potential future extensions of this work can be described in the following ways. First, our optimization model considers the potential vaccination center locations and each region’s overall capacity of local pharmacies. The specific distribution from the warehouse to each of the local pharmacies in each county is not included to not further complicate the model. In a future study, the local pharmacy supply chain and vaccine distribution over all pharmacies in a region can be incorporated. In such a detailed vaccine distribution problem, various vaccine transportation, storage modes, temperatures, and associated costs could be integrated into the model. Furthermore, in our case study, we use the real locations of the vaccine warehouse. Since the distance from the warehouse to the vaccination centers is the main factor that influences the vaccination center locations, the model chooses the closest county to the supply warehouse for each vaccine type as the corresponding vaccination center, despite the impact of the infection rate in each region. However, a future extension of this study could make the vaccine center locations more sensitive by incorporating a local supply chain and variable locations and numbers of vaccine warehouses (e.g., the vaccine warehouse location can be decided by the population or number of infections, and it can be changed for different time periods). In addition, our model assumes that the people in each county can only be served by the vaccine centers located in the closest county. In a real situation, human behavior is hard to capture, and some people may go to other places to receive vaccines due to the complex environment. Thus, various human behaviors that could impact vaccination policies could be incorporated into the model.

Although the agent-based simulation considers demographic differences, such as age, and the impact of different contact networks on disease transmission, the educational, social, and economic disparities among human populations could be explicitly incorporated into the model. Given the availability of the data, regions could be made more heterogeneous by including different socio-economic levels and varying vaccination and vaccine acceptance rates. Furthermore, specific variants and waning immunity of the infected or vaccinated population could be integrated into the models to capture further biological complexities of the disease. Our model only considers the overall vaccination strategies for the people against the spread of the disease. It would be interesting to study the specific vaccination strategies based on different risk groups and super spreaders. For instance, one may fix the number of vaccines but compare vaccination strategies targeting random people or age-based groups or groups with specific medical conditions.",Yes,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8002371,Yes,Covasim,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Engineering, Social Sciences, Industry","Information sciences, studies, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Economics, Business Management and Business Administration","Management Science and Information Systems, Oklahoma State University, Norman, OK, USA

We first present the validation results of the simulation-optimization model in Appendix Section A8.

Scenario “S2” represents a case where Pfizer has a lower
cost than Moderna and Janssen. We achieve this scenario by
changing the price of Pfizer to $7:91, while keeping all other
vaccines’ costs at their original price. Scenario “S3” repre-
sents that Janssen has the highest efficiency, where we
increase the efficiency of Janssen to 0.98 while reducing the
efficiency of Pfizer and Moderna. Scenario “S4” represents

Previous asymptomatic agents (la) become directly
Recovered, as we assume that they cannot die from COVID-19
without showing symptoms, whereas symptomatic ones have a
probability to recover or die (Figure 3).

t is important to note that ESM, despite the fact that it is
a more detailed model than most of those used in agent-based
models (19, 48), makes certain assumptions, some of which are
shared with other epidemiological models because of a lack of
knowledge about the disease, others because we assume that they
have no influence on the model itself.
1. Effective contact rate
(a) Presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals share the
same contact rate
(b) The contact rate does not differ during the
infectious period.
(c) Masks do not deliver any protection, but rather reduce
the effective contact rate of an infectious individual and
its viral release in the environment.
2. Environmental transmission
(a) Individuals can be infected by a contaminated
environment, and for a maximal viral contamination in
one building, the effective contact rate is the same as one
infectious Individual.
(b) The viral release of an Individual in its environment
(in our model, in Buildings) is the same for all
infectious Individuals
3. Homogeneity of the population
(a) The sex of individuals does not have any impact on the
epidemiological model.
(b) The age of individuals does not have any impact on the
incubation period, the proportion of asymptomatic cases,
and the effective contact rate for human to human and
environmental transmission
(c) Asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals share the
same infectious period distribution
4. Recovery and death
(a) Recovered Individuals are totally immunized against the
infection.
(b) Infection can lead to death only for Individuals expressing
a need for intensive care
c) Testing is performed only for virus isolation, not
antibodies, therefore recovered people are not
considered positive


Individual
agents can also enroll certain agents to participate in the Activity
(e.g., colleagues, friends . . . ) who are expected to have a closer
relationship, and therefore have a higher probability of being
infected. Since we have set the time step at 1 h, we decided not
to represent the movement itself from one place to another :
Individuals are translated directly from their current location to
the building chosen to perform their new Activity.
This last choice may appear to be a limitation (or at least a
somewhat too restrictive assumption), but it is consistent with the scale at which we model the disease and the control policy

The simulations presented here are limited in number, as the objective is not to provide exhaustive results, for which an overall sensitivity study would have been necessary, and which would in any case make no sense for this particular case study, but to show what can be achieved with the simulator

This first version of COMOKIT (version v1.0, released in May 2020) has however some limitations that are already identified and that we think we can gradually remove with the help of other modelers

Scaling up: in computational terms, an agent-based approach will always be more expensive than an aggregate approach, not only in terms of execution time, but also in terms of the necessary replications (with respect to deterministic mathematical models).

The second limitation of the model is related to the assumptions made regarding the representation of group activities

This strongly limits the representation of informal activities, such as markets or street restaurants, which are so common in Vietnam and other countries, outdoor public events (concerts, religious gatherings, etc.) or collective leisure activities (walks in pedestrian areas, parties, etc.), even though some of these activities (especially religious gatherings) are suspected to have contributed to the initial creation of clusters.",No,https://github.com/COMOKIT/ COMOKIT-Model,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Life Sciences, Industry","Artificial intelligence, Data processing, Information sciences, studies, Biological and Biomedical Sciences","UMI 209, UMMISCO, IRD, Sorbonne Université, Bondy, France

If agents have a very limited ability to reflect on the evidence (i.e., lower depths of the decision tree), then too few of them get vaccinated.

We also analyzed the number of agents changing their mind regarding vaccination.

Indeed, the observations of each agent are strictly cumulative, hence there is a perfect recollection of every that was observed previously.

Text:
Each individual is conceptualized as an agent with a set of attributes and behavioral rules. As mentioned above, the ABM framework consists of three models, namely (1) an opinion dynamics model that simulates how the agents update their epidemic risk awareness based on multiple information sources, (2) a behavioral adoption model that simulates agents' adoption of disease prevention measures

During an epidemic event, an agent can update its opinion on epidemic risk when new information becomes available. Considering that an individual might not always collect epidemic information to update its opinion at each time step, here we simulate agents' opinion dynamics process in a binary stochastic manner (Bassett et al., 2012). That is, at each time step t, an agent j either keeps its past opinion (μj, t = 0), or collects epidemic information to update its opinion on infectious risk (μj, t = 1). Naturally, an agent will form stronger opinions on epidemic risk (i.e., a larger value of O) when it receives more severe epidemic warnings and/ or when it observes more infected cases in its residential area

Here we consider that the epidemic information that agent j obtains at time t, denoted by Ij, t, is influenced by three sources of information, namely global information Ij, t G , social media Ij, t S , and neighbor observation Ij, t N (Fig. 1b). Global informationIj, t G refers to epidemic information released by governments via public broadcasting channels (e.g., television, radio, and other public notices).

Neighbor observation Ij, t N represents the epidemic information that agent j infers based on the health conditions of its neighboring agents (agent i and j are defined as neighbors if their proximity is smaller than a threshold value d ∗ )

As an agent becomes more aware of the epidemic risk, it will evaluate infection risk in the environment and make a decision on whether to adopt preventive behaviors or not

During an epidemic event, an agent can update its opinion on epidemic risk when new information becomes available. Considering that an individual might not always collect epidemic information to update its opinion at each time step, here we simulate agents' opinion dynamics process in a binary stochastic manner (Bassett et al., 2012). That is, at each time step t, an agent j either keeps its past opinion (μj, t = 0), or collects epidemic information to update its opinion on infectious risk (μj, t = 1). Naturally, an agent will form stronger opinions on epidemic risk (i.e., a larger value of O) when it receives more severe epidemic warnings and/ or when it observes more infected cases in its residential area.

An agent will update its opinion on epidemic risk when new epidemic information on epidemic risk becomes available. Following the classic Widrow-Hoff learning rule (Sutton, 1988; Widrow and Hoff, 1988; Widrow and Lehr, 1993), an agent's opinion formation process is represented by a general opinion dynamics model, as shown in Eq. (4). Oj,t ¼ Oj,t−1 þ θj % ∆I j,t ð4Þ where ΔIj, tis the difference between the agent's past opinion on opinion on epidemic risk and the new information on epidemic risk (i.e., ΔIj, t = Ij, t − Oj, t−1). θj ∈ [0,1] is agent j's behavioral factor that measures the extent to which the agent is willing to change its past opinion when new information is available (Anderson and Ye, 2019). An agent with a larger θ tends to give more weight to new information to update its opinion on epidemic risk. In comparison, an agent will not update its opinion on epidemic risk when θ is set to zero

On the one hand, an agent's opinion on epidemic risk can affect its decision-making on the adoption of preventive behaviors, and then affect the disease spreading process in the population. On the other hand, the dynamics of the disease spreading process can affect agents' opinion on infection risk since an agent's opinion is partially influenced by its observations of the health status of neighboring agents (reflected by the term Ij, t N). The evolution of agents' opinions on infection risk in turn affect the dynamics of agents' disease prevention behaviors (i.e., agents with stronger opinion on epidemic risk are more likely to adopt disease prevention measures).",General preventative behavior,"Non-pharmaceutical prevention behaviors (e.g., wearing face masks, contact precautions, social distancing) can affect disease transmission rate in a population, and are considered important measures to contain and control disease transmission in a population (Mao, 2011). The adoption of preventive behaviors can reduce transmission risk by a certain rate.",No,,Yes,"Following the classic Widrow-Hoff learning rule (Sutton, 1988; Widrow and Hoff, 1988;

This study focuses on building a three-layer modeling framework to understand the role of social media and individual behaviors in the spread of infectious diseases. Due to data incompleteness and the scope of this work, this study leaves some questions to be addressed in future. In particular, in this study, we adopt the concept of a regular lattice network to simulate agents' physical contact and social communication (Bassett et al., 2012). We wish to note that other types of graphs can also be applied to simulate agents' social networking. Some studies show that disease diffusion processes can be affected by agents' social networks (Almaatouq et al., 2020; Block et al., 2020; Cauchemez et al., 2011; Salje et al., 2016). For future work, we plan to apply other types of networks (e.g., small world network) to simulate agents' social interaction and physical contact, and assess the joint impacts of social contact network, individual behaviors and social media in the spread of infectious diseases. Second, the results of this study are based on a synthetic but representative residential area. Future research will aim to implement the model in a real-world case study area (e.g., the New York City in the U.S. and Wuhan in China). To do this, various sources of data are needed. The first set of data is on residential areas and the geographical distribution of residents (e.g., the boundary of residential areas, the spatial distribution of households and the number of family members of each household). These data can be acquired from the census bureau of local government, combined with high-resolution web mapping services such as remote sensing, satellite imagery and Google street map (Patela et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2018). The second set of data is on individuals' daily activities (e.g., daily routines and contacting networks), the usage of social media for person-to-person communication (e.g., the frequency of using social media, the number of social friends and the influencing weights of their opinions), and citizens' attitude towards epidemic risk and their social and economic conditions that may affect the adoption of disease prevention behaviors. These data can be acquired by following the approaches in choice experiment to conduct questionnaires and surveys in the neighborhood community, combined with data retrieval (e.g., crowd sourcing and web crawler) and advanced data mining techniques for geo-tagged social media data (Determann et al., 2014; Injadat et al., 2016; Jain and Katkar, 2015; Michaud et al., 2013; Roby et al., 2018; Viboud and Vespignani, 2019; Yang et al., 2019). The third set of data is on the characteristics and clinical features of infectious diseases, such as the basic reproductive number, the duration of the latent period, recovery period, and the discharge and fatality rate. These data can be obtained from public health centers (e.g., the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States) and/or from research articles and clinical reports (Leung, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020). Implementing the proposed model in real-world residential areas can be useful to further enhance our understanding of the role of social media and individual behaviors in disease transmission processes, and help policy makers and the public to better prepare for the future epidemic outbreaks. We envision that this paper can highlight the need and potential for environmental scientists, social scientists, economists, epidemiological researchers and policy makers to engage in interdisciplinary collaborations to understand epidemic diffusion mechanisms and help explore more effective disease control measures.

Let Gt ∈ [0,1] denote the value of epidemic risk released by the global source at time t. We assume that all the agents in the system will obtain the same global information (i.e., Ij, t G = Gt).

In this study, we simply assume that an agent will neither infect other agents, nor be infected by others, if it has adopted preventive behaviors.

We assume that an agent will adopt prevention behaviors if it thinks that it is sufficiently likely to be infected by the disease.

General assumptions for proposed scenarios

the intervention-weighted infectivity is assumed to be 0.0411/2 if half of the passengers do not wear the mask and the intervention- weighted infectivity is assumed to be 0.0411/ 5 if only 20% of the passengers do not wear mask

All passengers will go through all nodes (including health QR and temperature check, manual or automatic ticket check-in, and security check) and then stay at the waiting hall until departure

Table 3 show the cases of three different numbers of asymptomatic passengers (i.e., 1, 5, and 10 asymptomatic passengers randomly entering the CD-E-HSTS during the designated simulation period) with each case being simulated under 3 different mask-wearing adherence levels (i.e., 0%, 50%, and 80%, which represent the percen tage of passengers wearing masks)

Table 3 show the cases of three differ ent numbers of asymptomatic passengers (i.e., 1, 5, and 10 asymptomatic passengers randomly entering the CD-E-HSTS during the designated simulation period) with each case being simulated under 3 different mask-wearing adherence levels (i.e., 0%, 50%, and 80%, which represent the percentage of passengers wearing masks).

Figure 8 provides the comparison of the number of infections for three containment measures, i.e., as-is, enforcing social distance (ESD), and passenger flow control (PFC), under each of the four settings.
",Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft),"In the defined simulation context, we can see that under the assumption of one asymptomatic passenger, the number of infections can be reduced by a range of 25%~40%, with a 50% face mask wearing adherence level, and the infection reduction rate can be a range of 60%~75% for 80% adherence level compared to when no one wears masks.

For more details on all parameters and all parameter values used, the reader is referred to the Appendix, Section A1.3.3.

Extending the ideas of location tracing, we studied the effects of individual tracing of contacts. For this tracing policy, we assume that a certain amount of people record their contacts outside of their household, for instance, by using a tracing app on their smartphone or on a similar device. In this process, a contact is recorded if both involved persons use the tracing device. We assume that the tracing is completely accurate. In this way, all contacts between persons using the tracing device are recorded, and most importantly, there is no infection between 2 tracing people that goes undetected. 

Limitations

We distinguish between limitations of the study design, limitations of the simulation results, and limitations of the model as a decision support tool.

First, the study design does not include any testing of detected contact persons. Finding additional positive cases within contact partners would increase the capabil-ities of the strategy to enhance tracing to the next generation and would slightly increase the efficacy of the policy. Moreover, the study does not specifically regard sensitivity or specificity of the test that is used to determine the index cases for contact tracing. Test sensitivity is implicitly depicted in the general detection probability of COVID-19 cases. Test specificity is not regarded at all, which was already analyzed in the ‘‘Discussion’’ section. Moreover, the duration between the start of infectivity and the receiving of the test result is parametrized for typical PCR tests and might be different for antigen tests or others. The reader is referred to the parameter tables in the Appendix for more information.

The model results are, as all simulation outcomes, limited by modeling and data uncertainty: many disease parameters of the novel coronavirus are still unknown and will surely improve in the future because of increasing availability of data. In particular, the model suffers from the reporting bias of the calibration data. The constantly changing and limited availability of tests in the first months of the disease might cause the data to estimate the real epidemiology falsely.

Moreover, the parameters and the modeling assumptions for the tracing strategies are based on expert opinions. Consequently, the tracing algorithm is modeled in an oversimplified form and cannot validly depict the actual work of professional contract tracers. Similarly, the strategy for location closure is implemented in an extremely strict fashion, since the occurrence of only 1 positive case would cause preventive closure of the entire workplace. In reality, more balanced solutions would probably be implemented, wherein the measure is applied after a higher threshold is reached (e.g., multiple positive tested employees) or for certain parts of the workplace (e.g., individual offices).

Interpreted as a decision support tool, the model is primarily limited by comparably long computation times and fundamental simplifications made during the modeling process. The prior is caused by the problem that the model cannot be scaled down and always requires simulation with the full population of the country. Thus, a huge number of agents (about 9 million for Austria) leads to long computation times, and the necessity of Monte Carlo simulation for flattening of stochastic results increases the time required to increase the simulation output even more. Consequently, the simulation’s capabilities of dealing with multivariate calibration problems are limited, and the model is capable, yet unhandy, of generating short-term prognoses.",No,,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Engineering, Life Sciences, Industry","Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Health Sciences","TU Wien, Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Vienna, Austria

Finally, the infection probability and the impact of the already implemented lockdown measures in Austria were calibrated using the officially reported Austrian COVID-19 cases by EMS as a reference.

About 12,900 positive virus tests had been reported until this date.[i] To guarantee that the final state of the initialization phase matches this number, a calibration process was performed adjusting both infectivity and impact of lockdown policies. This process is, in more detail, described in the Appendix, Section A1.3.4. The country implemented nationwide closure of schools and workplaces on March 16, yet our calibration process revealed that this lockdown should rather be modeled as a process with several steps, which are briefly listed in the Appendix, Table A7. It is apparent that the modeled policy events and, in particular, their parametrization cannot be taken into account separately; some of them might have a larger and some a smaller impact in reality than in the model. However, the summary of all policies allowed us to calibrate the current curve of the disease by feasible and causally founded assumptions.

Technically, finding these stagnation levels is related to a calibration process. In this process, the calibration value is the parameter of an infectivity reduction event scheduled for leisure time, workplace, and schools, which is scheduled for May 15 (the same date as the introduction of the tracing policy). The value is calibrated between 100% (contacts are not infectious anymore) and 0% (contacts are fully infectious, that is, as infectious as calibrated in the initialization phase scenario). A standard bisection method is used with a Monte Carlo simulation (12 runs each) in the loop. Because stagnation of the case numbers is the goal of the calibration process, the target value of the calibration routine is defined as the slope of the regression line fitted through the simulated time series of the new confirmed cases per day between June 1 and July 1.

For calibration purposes, a bisection algorithm was applied to iteratively improve the value of one parameter value after the other. This strategy is possible as the impact of the calibrated parameters can be measured at different points in time: the base infection probability can be calibrated in the period before the introduction of measures, the impact of the first policy can be calibrated in the period between the first and the second, and so forth. Hence, the multidimensional calibration problem can be decoupled into several scalar ones. More on this strategy is found in the Appendix, Section A1.3.4. The calibrated parameters as well as a plot comparing the real reported cases and the confirmed cases from the calibrated model are found in Appendix A4.

Moreover, recent results from Austria contribute to the validation process of this study. ",Yes,"Adjusting within calibration resembles sensitivity testing, shown for the no-tracing policy

Our current work facilitates this by enabling localized calibration of ABM to infection dynamics in the specific geography.

In this paper we experimentally compare its performance difference compared to other models when our calibration methods are used for qualitative decisions with local geographic variables.

Together, these allow us to build realistic simulators and efficiently calibrate them using gradient-based learning over multiple runs of the simulator.

The calibration of these parameters is done by matching estimates of the simulator with real-world observed cumulative death statistics.

2.3. Regional variables for model calibration using deep neural networks
First, the calibration neural network (CalibNN) takes input from varied data sources and predicts simulation parameters for disease transmission and progression.

Our proposed method (row-3) alleviates computational challenges by allowing region-specific calibration using an agent-based model which can capture heterogeneous interactions in the population through calibration of parameters using both local data and neural networks. This improved calibration is shown by better validation performance in the Table 1 below.

To investigate the robustness of our proposed calibration procedure, we run experiments using ground truth data distorted by gaussian noise.

The goal of our experiment is to evaluate whether calibrating on regional variables impacts strategy at a local level.

This difference reflects calibrating regional variables using our CalibNN method that can change outcomes.

The different needs are all replenished by the actions that are performed.,Stay at home;  Contact tracing ,"From the results of the simulations, it was found that the track and tracing app would have a very limited effect, even with a very high uptake of the app by society. At the time when these simulations were run (April 2020), this was a surprising and deviating prediction from what other models 
predicted. Intuitively, the app would warn people much quicker that they had been in contact with someone that had tested positive. Therefore, these people could self-isolate much quicker and thus being prevented to infect others. 

Therefore, the agents will look for 
alternatives to satisfy a need if the default way is blocked by a curfew.

The different needs are all replenished by the actions that are performed. For example, eating will contribute to survival and eating with the family will also contribute to belonging. Over time, the needs will deplete and become more salient. This model allows for agents to balance all their needs without fixing any order, which makes it quite flexible to the environment and context. The state of all needs together represent an implicit internal state of 
well-being of the agent. The mechanism makes sure that agents do not only take care of immediate needs but also of longer term needs. Therefore, it is well suited for modeling scenarios that range 
over a couple of weeks or months. Another important aspect one can note from this underlying model is that the actual action that is chosen to be performed will depend on both the available actions as well as the current combined state of all needs. This makes it very difficult to predict the exact sequence of actions an agent will perform. Thus, in general, it will not be easy to make precise temporal predictions on the basis of this model. For example, if the need for belonging is deprived 
due to the COVID-19 restrictions it will at some point in time lead to a violation of isolation constraints. However, when this will happen exactly also depends on the state of the other needs and opportunities to interact with others.

In particular, we assume that index cases are introduced either through an employee or a resident from outside the home.

While occasional contacts between different wards of the same facility are possible, we assume wards to function independently from each other.

We assume that the age of employees is uniformly distributed between 20 and 59 years.

For residents, we assume a probability to develop symptoms of 64.52%, corresponding to the value reported by Poletti et al. for people aged 80 and above.

See electronic supplementary material, note S1 for details of model design, implementation and assumptions, electronic supplementary material, note S2 for an overview of all model parameters and their sources and electronic supplementary material, note S3 for details about the calibration.

For sake of simplicity, we model the time-dependent sensitivity of all simulated tests by assuming that there is a limited time window within which they detect an infection (or its absence) with certainty and by varying the onset and duration of this time window between different types of test (see electronic supplementary material, note S1 ‘Test technologies’ for details).

Nevertheless, this result depends on the efficacy of vaccines next to our other modelling assumptions.

Our model has several limitations: the co-location networks are based on the architecture of nursing home wards, insights of practitioners, and data about occupancy, shared rooms and shared lunch tables at the time of outbreaks and therefore not based on empirical measurements of contacts. We assume that the contact patterns do not change depending on the testing strategy (e.g. contacts to take swab samples). While these assumptions are based on insights from practitioners, these contact patterns are not based on observational data.

Furthermore, though most model parameters have been calibrated using individual-level observational data, some simplifying assumptions had to be made: all contacts of a given type (e.g. roommates) are assumed to have the same transmission probability, independent of other environmental factors.

We do not model different adherence rates to voluntary testing and assume a 100% adherence rate in all scenarios.

7.1. Limitation of the Study Despite the high potential of applying the proposed HS approach, some limitations characterize this work and should be addressed in the future. The first limitation of the proposed model is that the population supposed is always new and analyzed only inside the space modeled, i.e., for class hours. Therefore, there is no possibility of considering the individual variation: each participant is equal to the others and is defined from the same variable values. Only the states of entry vary in the model (they can be healthy, latent and symptomatic). For this reason, the model does not allow the evaluation of factors that can be analyzed over time, such as the effect of a quarantine. Another limitation involves the settings of the contagiousness index and contagion probability, which have been chosen to maintain a cautious attitude, considering the worst case scenario. Better estimations of these parameters can be achieved by analyzing the epidemiological situation of the specific area in which the simulated facility is located, simultaneously considering the age and job of the individuals, the means of transport they utilize to reach the facility, and so on. Moreover, a more significant statistical analysis of these simulation results could be performed, increasing the number of replications for the simulation runs of each scenario. Finally, another limitation concerns the contagion mechanism that have been used to replicate the virus diffusion, which is based on the 15 min contact under the safety distance of 2 m. Even if this model is appropriate in many cases (i.e., factories in which spaces are enormous and contagion effectively occur due to the strict contacts between people), other approaches can be used in tiny spaces, such as in classrooms and schools. Since some data are now becoming available about how the droplet diffusion in closed spaces can promote the virus diffusion while social distancing is respected, different ABMs can be provided to take into account this aspect. In addition, the defined parameters are not currently able to capture the presence of several variants at the same time with different contagion logics.

The semester consists of 62 days of lectures, but in the AnyLogic model run, it has been decided to consider five days since, as already pointed out, it is assumed that each day the population of students is new, namely new individuals with the related state (healthy, contaminated, latent, symptomatic) enter the system every day according to the probabilities defined

It is also assumed that the social distancing is respected (2 m), but also the correct ventilation of closed places and the proper sanitation of environments and surfaces, according to the WHO indications, are applied.

Even if the model is randomized, the data are rationally consistent with the given inputs: to mathematically calculate the number of infected entrants with the given variables, first of all, the number of daily participants has been multiplied by five days (assumption: 5 days/week), then the result must be multiplied by the contagiousness index, under these circumstances equal to 0.0029.

It was not chosen at random, but rather the index was calculated without regard to the assumption that only individuals between the ages of 19 and 50 enter the University.

Bringing all this back to the HS model, in Scenario 2, it can be assumed that 100% of the students are now all wearing FFP2 masks, which is the most filtering type. This assumption implies a changed Contagion Probability parameter.",No,,No,,One discipline,Engineering,"Other Engineering,  Management, Information and Production Engineering","Department of Management, Information and Production Engineering, University of Bergamo, 24044 Dalmine, Italy",Yes,"Validation: validation should be done throughout the entire simulation study [38], in particular, in the building of the model it is necessary to interact with decision-makers to check the reliability of the parameters’ values set in the model.

The change evidenced by the results increases the number of infected individuals at the model entry, but this is justifiable, since the input variable changed (Contagiousness Index) is proportional to the number of those infected. The individuals contaminated inside are little affected by the increased Contagiousness Index. The goal of this sensitivity analysis, in addition to testing the robustness, is undoubtedly identifying any errors in the model by encountering unexpected relationships between inputs and outputs to gain a greater understanding of the relationships between variables

The case study also has the function to check and validate whether the containment measures adopted effectively prevent contagion in the university environment

5.2. Model Validation Scenarios

A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the effects produced by changes related to input parameters on the simulation outputs, i.e., to validate the correctness of the model [61].",Yes,"In consideration of all these related works, combining the strength of ABM and DES, this study aims to cover all the four essential aspects needed to support the re-organization of people flows and internal processes in the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., Model a variety of possible individual infection phases/interactions, Describe inner behavior uncertainties for the individual, Model individual actions and organizational processes in time and space, Monitor and evaluate the spread of the contagion within different control policies).

Five replications have been run for each scenario

Indeed, the number of contaminated people within the University resulting from these simulations is next to zero and, statistically analyzing the simulation outputs, it is possible to say that the contaminated people are a maximum of 0.8 individuals/week within the 95% confidence level.

Even if the model is randomized, the data are rationally consistent with the given inputs: to mathematically calculate the number of infected entrants with the given variables, first of all, the number of daily participants has been multiplied by five days (assumption: 5 days/week), then the result must be multiplied by the contagiousness index, under these circumstances equal to 0.0029.

In order to test the robustness of the model under study, another simulation has been executed varying only the input regarding the contagiousness index: it is no longer equal to 0.0029, but now corresponds to 0.0046 (Validation Scenario).

The goal of this sensitivity analysis, in addition to testing the robustness, is undoubtedly identifying any errors in the model by encountering unexpected relationships between inputs and outputs to gain a greater understanding of the relationships between variables.

Indeed, when doubling the occupation of the classrooms, and therefore allowing more students to attend the lectures, the number of infected individuals within the engineering buildings increases. With an average number of 7.2 infected individuals entering the systems, a similar number of students are contaminated during the week (6). Considering a 95% confidence level, the maximum number of contaminated individuals rises to 11.

From the results (Table 10), FPP2 masks will reduce the number of individuals contaminated inside the university buildings, which are less than one individual/week. Moreover, considering the 95% confidence level, the maximum number of individuals contaminated is 2.4; this result is comparable with the solution of the Base Scenario and Validation Scenario, showing how the requirement to wear protective equipment can be an effective measure to contain the contagion while allowing for higher saturation of spaces"

A positive impact of the partial progressive rollout which covers up to 40% of the population by mid-September is counterbalanced by a delayed start of the tighter lockdown, with the 12-day delay leading to a higher peak-incidence, as can be seen by
comparing Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 4. ","Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Get tested;  case isolation (stay at home, get tested), home quarantine (stay at home), school closures","Using a re-calibrated agent-based model, we explored a feasible range of non-pharmaceutical interventions, including case isolation, home quarantine, school closures, and stay-at-home restrictions (i.e., “social distancing.”)

This study addresses several important questions. Firstly, we investigate a feasible range of key non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs): case isolation, home quarantine, school closures, and social distancing, available to control virus transmission within a population with a low immunity. Social distancing (SD) is interpreted and modelled in a broad sense of comprehensive stay-at-home restrictions, comprising several specific behavioural changes that reduce the intensity of interactions among individuals (and hence the virus transmission probability), including physical distancing, mobility reduction, mask wearing, and so on.

Secondly, in a counter-factual mode, we quantify under what conditions the initial outbreak could have been suppressed, aiming to clarify the extent of required NPIs during an early outbreak phase with low vaccination coverage, in comparison to previous pandemic control measures successfully deployed in Australia.",Yes,"The inferred levels of social distancing are supported by real world mobility data (37). Specifically, when compared to baseline (i.e., the median value for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period 3 January–6 February 2020, as set by data provider to represent the pre-pandemic levels), the reports for July 16 showed 31% reduction of mobility at workplaces, and 37% reduction of mobility in retail and recreation settings, with concurrent 65% reduction of mobility on public transport. On July 21, the mobility reductions were reported as 43% (workplaces), 41% (retail and recreation), and 72% (public transport).",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"As shown in Figure 1, the modelling horizon was set to July 25 and assumed a progressive vaccination rollout in addition to a tighter lockdown being imposed at 400 cases (corresponding to July 9). 

Social distancing at SD = 0.9 is probably infeasible (as this assumes that 90% of the population consistently stays at home), but would reduce the new cases to below 10 a day within four weeks (25 days) following the peak in incidence.


(Sensitivity of suppression outcomes for tight restrictions) presents results obtained for the scenarios which assume a limited pre-pandemic

In addition, we did not consider a diminishing
vaccine efficacy, given that the temporal scope of the study was limited to a relatively short period of 6 months (June–November 2021) during which a progressive rollout was modelled. 


Another limitation is that the surrogate ABM population which corresponds to the latest available Australian Census data from 2016 (23.4M individuals, with 4.45M in Sydney) is smaller than the current Australian population (25.8M, with 4.99M in Sydney).

Using a re-calibrated agent-based model, we explored a feasible range of non-pharmaceutical interventions

The model has previously been calibrated to produce characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic corresponding to the ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (1, 17), using actual case data from the first and second waves in Australia, and re-calibrated for B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant using incidence data of the Sydney outbreak (see Supplementary Material: Model calibration).

Using the ABM calibrated to the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, we varied the macro- and micro-parameters (for CI, HQ, SC, and SD), aiming to match the incidence data recorded during the Sydney outbreak in a retrodiction mode

Our Australia-wide model was calibrated by 31 August 2021, adopting a higher fraction of symptomatic children, σc = 0.268 (see Supplementary Material: Model calibration).

The model was also calibrated to the basic reproduction number of the ancestral lineage (R0 ≈ 3.0, adjusted R0 ≈ 2.75), and used the same moderate interaction strengths as the initial study (1) (except SDc = 0.25, reduced to match the second wave in Melbourne in 2020). 

In this work, we re-calibrated the ABM to incidence data from the ongoing third pandemic wave in Australia driven by the Delta variant. The reproductive number was calibrated to be at least twice as high (R0 = 5.97) as the one previously estimated for pandemic waves in Australia.

SC and MP designed the computational experiments, re-calibrated the model, and estimated hospitalisations, ICU occupancy, and potential fatalities. CZ implemented simulations of progressive vaccination and social distancing policies.

Nevertheless, the study included a sensitivity analysis of the vaccine efficacy across three static levels.

Finally, we offer and validate a projection for the peak of case incidence across the nation, formed in response to a progressive vaccination campaign rolling out concurrently with the strict lockdown measures adopted in NSW, VIC, and ACT

The model was cross-validated with genomic surveillance data (6), and contributed to policy recommendations on social distancing that were broadly adopted by the World Health Organisation (18).

This projection is validated by the actual profiles, as shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 11.

The actual incidence curve is traced between the profiles formed by SD = 0.4 and SD = 0.5, with the latter providing the best match.

This projection is validated by the actual profiles, as shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 11.

We followed a simplistic assumption that the cessation of community-wide measures and the implementation of age-stratified measures would occur on the same day (1 January 2021).

Individuals from the target group were assumed to have perfect compliance to these measures which was maintained across the entire model run.

Given our assumption that the infection-preventing vaccine fully prevents transmission (i.e. a null probability of getting infected for 95% of the population vaccinated), this scenario therefore incorporates the most optimistic infection-preventing characteristics of a highly effective vaccine.

Limitations
Certain limitations are inherent in the model due to uncertainty on specific data regarding SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, including transmission probability in asymptomatic individuals and whether the protection following natural infection is long-lasting. The model, which aimed to represent community transmission in the general Canadian population, did not consider transmission in healthcare and long-term facility settings, as these environments would involve specific prevention interventions that differ from the PHMs implemented within the community. Furthermore, although the detection and isolation rates have most likely varied over time and between jurisdictions during the course of the pandemic, data on these specific spatio-temporal changes were unavailable and therefore these rates were kept constant in the model for simplicity. Our model is parametrized using the best available data on the age-specific proportions of cases that require hospitalization care and/or die, which is based on surveillance data and is consistent with observations [57,58] and estimates used in other modelling studies of this type [59].

We are cognizant of the limitations of our approach. For computational simplicity we assume that agent routines remain unaltered over time and this reduces some of the variance in human behavior. For lack of alternative, some of the model’s parameters are randomly distributed. The model is tested at a relatively small-scale area which is far from a closed system. We do not simulate reoccurring external infections and variations in virus characteristics. Nor is contact tracing computed and consequently quarantine is limited to family members. Finally, differential lockdowns are based on place of residence and not place of infection and thus may not truly realize the potential of this containment measure as it does not cut contagion chains at their source. These limitations notwithstanding, the model provides a robust foundation for dealing with all of these challenges. Some of them require minimal changes to the code, for example variability in routines and contact tracing. Others require stronger computing infrastructure, cloud computing and reworking of the code in order to scale-up the model to the level of the city.

",,,,,,,,,,,  Unclear,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions

In this work we have made several assumptions which we summarize here. First, the NPIs are the same for all the cities, i.e. they are homo­geneously applied to the entire country despite the fact that there may be some differences between the regions. Given that these differences are small, we believe that they should not have a big impact on the simulation outcome. Secondly, the contact matrices (for population mixing) apply to a pre-COVID-19 scenario. Given that the social model of the simulator reflects distancing policies that restrict contacts be­tween certain population groups, population mixing is reduced to what could realistically happen in a pandemic scenario. Thirdly, we assume that the sensitivity value of the PCR tests is 100%. A smaller sensitivity would produce a larger number of undetected cases. However, given that current testing achieves very high values, the effect of this assumption should not be significant. 

These values, collected from Ref. [29], correspond to the percentage of population that was already infected with COVID-19 before the start of the third wave. In this work, we assume that these individuals have become immune to COVID-19 and they will not be able to be reinfected during the entire simulation time. 

Limitations

EpiGraph has several limitations, some of them related to the disease model. In the current version of EpiGraph, a recovered individual ac­quires indefinite immunity to the virus, which makes it impossible to be re-infected for the duration of the simulation, which can be inaccurate, specially for long-term simulations. EpiGraph does not consider attri­butes such as previous pathologies, and other factors not well under­stood for now, that may also come into play when we evaluate risk of developing COVID-19 severe symptoms. Adding such attributes is straightforward. Our transmission model does not include other trans­missions models such as surface contact, which are relevant for COVID when the population is not using masks or not washing their hands often. 

Another limitation is related to the transportation model. In the model, the movement of individuals between cities depends on the distance between the cities and the population size. Having real knowledge about mobility patterns, for instance about those individuals using public transportation means, would provide a much more realistic approximation in this model. In our experiments we only model the largest urban regions in Spain; we could add more information related to smaller cities and towns, including rural regions.

Given that the closure of educational centers intervention had been employed in Montreal as of the COVID-19 outbreak, this intervention was assumed in our model at the outset. Besides, two other crucial yet underappreciated control interventions were considered, and their efficacy was investigated. The functionality of the control interventions was explicitly described in this section.

Reduction in human movements: the outbreak of COVID-19 desists in the unmitigated absence of people’s movements; so, one of the factors playing a significant role in the COVID-19 outbreak is people mobility. To consider this intervention in the model, the fraction of human agents’ movement to the specific places was reduced regarding the land use of the places as well as the occupation of the human agents.

Self-isolation upon symptoms: self-isolation refers to the separation of infectious
people from the rest of the people to protect non-infected people (i.e., the infectious people get quarantined). Following this intervention, infectious people stop moving as well as interacting with others; accordingly, this intervention might end up greatly reducing the number of infected people. To apply the self-isolation intervention in the model, the movements and interactions of infectious human agents were completely restricted in the model.

In this study, each human agent was considered as a representative of 100 people in the real world. Each human agent was assigned to a specific household and the households were formed according to the household's size. Rather than being distributed individually, human agents were distributed in the context of the household. The distribution of households was done regarding the population density map and the Roulette Wheel method.

Given that the closure of educational centers intervention had been employed in Montreal as of the COVID-19 outbreak, this intervention was assumed in our model at the outset.

This study concentrated on the development of a GIS-based ABM in which the COVID-19 outbreak was assumed among heterogeneous populations so that their exclusive interactions and movements were considered in a spatial-based environment.

Limitations

Notwithstanding these strengths, this study had certain limitations in terms of model validation. The model was validated regarding the temporal pattern of COVID-19 and the validation of the model from a spatial perspective was not feasible due to the lack of spatial COVID-19 occurrences data at the city scale. Besides, owing to the computationally intensive nature of agent-based models and the limited memory capacity of computers, not all the population and activities could be considered. Accordingly, each agent was considered as the representative of 100 individuals in the real world. As a result, this widened the gap between the results of the model and reality and consequently affects the validation of the model. This is also another limitation in the validation of agent-based models.",No,,No,,One discipline,Social Sciences,Geography,"Laboratory of Environmental Geosimulation (LEDGE), Department of Geography, University of Montreal, 1375 Avenue Thérèse-Lavoie-Roux, Montréal, QC H2V 0B3, Canada",No,,Verification; Calibration; Validation,"Furthermore, our scenarios revealed that if instead of 42% (i.e., the adjusted value in the calibration), 10%, 20%, and 30% of infectious people had followed the self-isolation measure, the number of infected people would have risen by approximately 259, 207, and 83 more each week, on average, respectively

3.2. Model Calibration and Validation

Adjusting values for unknown parameters at the initial condition of the model was performed using the HM method. The proposed model was calibrated when the value of 1, 3, and 42% were assigned to the number of exposed human agents, the number of infectious human agents, and the percentage of people isolating themselves upon transition to infectious status, respectively. Irrespective of assuming the observations’ uncertainty equals zero due to the lack of direct means to measure them several times, disease statistics contain various sources of error [50]. Accordingly, to reduce the impact of observations’ uncertainty on the model, the model’s outputs were evaluated based on the weekly cases. Having adjusted the values found for the unknown parameters in the calibration procedure, the proposed model was validated using the Chi-square test. c2 yielded the value of 9.2879, which in comparison to the critical value (i.e., X2 0.05(4) = 9.488) was lower and demonstrated the acceptance of the null hypothesis. In other words, the Chi-square test indicated that the results of our model were close enough to actual observed values.

2.3.5. Calibration and Validation Calibration and validation are ongoing challenges in the ABM approach. Calibration entails running the model with various parameters and comparing the output to empirical data to find parameter settings that minimize the model’s error. There are two main quantitative calibration approaches for ABMs: (1) point estimation; and (2) categorical or distributional estimation [46]. While the point estimation approach seeks out a single parameter combination that provides the best fit to data, the categorical estimation approach assigns a probability to numerous parameter possibilities across a range of reasonable values [47]. Besides, the categorical calibration approach has the benefit of providing supplementary information on parameter uncertainty as well as the uncertainty of the model’s results. Amongst various categorical calibration methods, we used the history matching (HM) method to calibrate our model due to its ability in considering uncertainties of the model and observations [48]. The methodology of the HM method was presented in Figure 5.

2.3.4. Verification Process The first step prior to interpreting the results of the model is making sure of its consistency with its design concepts (i.e., verification process) [45]. To do so, two arbitrary scenarios were designed, and the verification of the model was evaluated in each scenario by maintaining all parameters constant and changing only one parameter. The number of infectious human agents at the beginning of the simulation and the reduction in human agents’ movement to the public places were altered in the first and second scenarios, respectively, while the other parameters were left unchanged",Yes,"Table 1. Summary of the input parameters

Besides, the infectiousness of infected individuals with no symptoms and mild symptoms was 0.33 and 0.72 times that of those with severe symptoms, respectively [36]. Additionally, following Mossong et al., 2008 [44], the value for the number of daily interactions was derived using a normal distribution and assigned to human agents with regard to their age (Table A5)

Calibration entails running the model with various parameters and comparing the output to empirical data to find parameter settings that minimize the model’s error

Besides, the categorical calibration approach has the benefit of providing supplementary information on parameter uncertainty as well as the uncertainty of the model’s results. Amongst various categorical calibration methods, we used the history matching (HM) method to calibrate our model due to its ability in considering uncertainties of the model and observations [48]. The methodology of the HM method was presented in Figure 5

The unknown parameters in our model were: the number of exposed and infectious cases at the beginning of the simulation (i.e., the date 5 January 2021, was considered as the beginning of the simulation) as well as the unknown percentage of people who isolated themselves (i.e., get quarantined) upon transition to infectious status. The number of newly infected human agents on a weekly basis was considered as the output of the model. Since the model’s unknown parameters were either percentages or positive integers, the potential ranges for each parameter (i.e., the parameter space) were determined to be between 0 and 1 for percentages and larger than zero for the remaining parameters. Since the unknown parameters’ spaces were large and continuous, the Latin-Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method was used to pick samples to run the HM method on the parameter space [48]. The uncertainties in our model were estimated by exploring the parameter space of a model by picking a subset of the samples from different clusters. Having run the model once for each sample, the variance of the errors across samples was determined according to Equation (3). Besides, the observations’ uncertainty was set to zero since there were no direct means to measure them several times and calculate the variance. Vr m = 1 N

Here, Vr s is the ensemble variance, K is the total number of runs in an ensemble, f r (xn) is the rth output from the kth run of the model with parameters xn, and Er (xn) is the average model error across the ensembles. To calculate the implausibility of a set of inputs and investigate their eligibility, the model output was compared to the expected output assuming observations’ uncertainty equals zero Equation (6). I r (x) = (zr

In the first scenario, we evaluated 10, 20, and 40 infectious human agents and compared the average number of newly infected human agents derived after 30 runs. After 30 runs,

In the second scenario, we considered three different reductions in human mobility to public places: 10%, 30%, and 50%. For each of these three settings, the model was run 30 times, and the average numbers of newly infected human agents were compared

3.2. Model Calibration and Validation Adjusting values for unknown parameters at the initial condition of the model was performed using the HM method. The proposed model was calibrated when the value of 1, 3, and 42% were assigned to the number of exposed human agents, the number of infectious human agents, and the percentage of people isolating themselves upon transition to infectious status, respectively. Irrespective of assuming the observations’ uncertainty equals zero due to the lack of direct means to measure them several times, disease statistics contain various sources of error [50].

We assumed that transmission occurred through contact only and did not strictly consider the airborne transmission. Except for roommates who were modeled explicitly, we assumed homogeneous (i.e., random) mixing.

We made the conservative assumption of the same VL distribution for asymptomatic and symptomatic infections [25].

We assumed that the sensitivity of the tests depended only on VL dynamics and did not incorporate other factors, such as variations in sample quality.

Based on the available parameters of these tests, antigen testing was assumed to have a higher limit of detection (LOD) and lower sensitivity relative to PCR.

In addition, PCR was assumed to have one more test-related contact than a rapid antigen (Table S2 in Appendix A).

We assumed that contacts in the community were necessary.

The immunity-based staffing intervention prioritized placing recovered staff members, who were assumed to be immune, in the non-COVID-19 cohort, leaving susceptible staff members to work in the COVID-19 cohort. Importantly, we assumed adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff and masks for residents to reduce infection risk.

Based on the above results, we assumed that the factors affecting the efficiency of the testing strategy might be ① delays in results turnaround time, ② detection limits of VL, and ③ testing-related contact.

5. Limitations This study has some limitations. To facilitate model building and analysis, we made several conservative simplified assumptions. First, we assumed no difference in VL dynamics between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and ignored the persistent low VLs after individuals are no longer infectious [26]. 

Second, although we incorporated varying transmission risks based on the type of contact (resident–staff, resident–resident, and staff–staff), we did not explicitly model different staff roles that may have different levels of risk.

Therefore, we are unable to determine the impact of demographic factors like age and sex on infectiousness variation. Also, we cannot disentangle the host behaviors from biological factors. Previous analysis suggested no evidence of the impact of age on infectiousness of cases (Lau et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021). In addition, we could not include factors affecting susceptibility to infection. Our estimates of infectiousness variation should be interpreted in light of these limitations: they capture heterogeneity in infectiousness due to demographic, host, and biological factors. However, in one study that included susceptibility component in the estimation of individual infectiousness, substantial heterogeneity remained with 20% of cases estimated to contribute to 80% of transmission (Tsang et al., 2022).

Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis as follows

A sensitivity analysis of using normal distribution (main analysis) instead of lognormal distribution (sensitivity analysis) for individual infectiousness.
",Yes,"By fitting individual- based household transmission models to these data, accounting for number of contacts and baseline transmission probabilities, the pooled estimate suggests that the 20% most infectious cases have 3.1- fold (95% confidence interval: 2.2- to 4.2- fold) higher infectiousness than average cases, which is consistent with the observed heterogeneity in viral shedding

Figure shows the estimates of infectiousness variation ( σ ), the estimated probability of infection from community and estimated probability of infection from households, and the reduction in deviance information criteriion (DIC) compared with the model without infectiousness variation. Models are fitted separately to 14 household transmission studies

From these 12 studies, the estimated infectiousness variation ( σ ranged from 1.03 to 2.83. This suggests that, the 20% most infectious cases are 2.4- to 10- fold more infectious than the average case. Based on the two largest studies with 6782 and 3727 households (Carazo et al., 2022; Lyngse et al., 2022), the estimated infectiousness variation is 1.48 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.29, 1.7) and 1.41 (95% CrI: 1.19, 1.72), suggesting that, among all cases, the 20% most infectious are 3.5- fold (95% CrI: 3.0- to 4.2- fold) and 3.3- fold (95% CrI: 2.7- to 4.3- fold) more infectious than the average case

Simulation studies demonstrated that there is no important systematic bias, with 88–100% (depending on the parameter) of the 95% credible intervals covering the simulation value (Appendix1—table 8).

Figure 3. Estimate distribution of relative infectiousness based on the pooled estimate. Red line indicates the estimated distribution and the gray lines indicate the associated uncertainty.

We conduct random effects meta- analyses on estimates of individual infectiousness from the 14 identified studies. The pooled estimate of infectiousness variation is 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95, 1.70), suggesting that the 20% most infectious cases are 3.1- fold (95%CI: 2.2- to 4.2- fold) more infectious than the average case (Figure3). Based on this fitted distribution, we estimate that 5.9% (95% CI: 1.4%, 11.1%) and 14.9% (95% CI: 7.2%, 20.7%) of cases could be at least 8- and 4- fold more infectious than average cases, respectively.

We estimate that doubling SAR are associated with 0.55 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.89) unit decrease in infectiousness variation, with R- squared equal to 67% respectively.

The pooled estimate of infectiousness variation from 14 studies suggests that the 20% most infectious cases have 3.1- fold (95%CI: 2.2- to 4.2- fold) higher infectiousness compared with average index cases

Our estimates of infectiousness variation should be interpreted in light of these limitations: they capture heterogeneity in infectiousness due to demographic, host, and biological factors.

Since the data were extracted from publication, the infection time of all cases was unavailable for all studies. Also, the individual infectiousness parameters δ for cases were augmented variables. Therefore, we conducted our inference under a Bayesian framework using data augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to joint estimate the model parameters, the missing infection time, and augmented variables using metropolis- hasting algorithm. We separately fitted this model to identified studies.

One run takes about 3hr on our typical desktop computer. We fitted the model to all studies, but only 14 of them could converge and provide robust estimates of individual infectiousness.

Building on previous modelling effort of social care provision, we present an agent‑based computational model to investigate social care provision in the context of a pandemic (using as an example, the early stages of the Covid‑19 pandemic), and related mitigation policies, on social care demand and supply, using a proof‑of‑concept agent‑based model (ABM). We show how policy solutions aimed at controlling the pandemic may have substantial effects on the level of unmet social care need and propose that such models may help policymakers to compare alternative containment policies, taking into account their side effects on the social care provision process.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",Yes,"We show how policy solutions aimed at controlling the pandemic may have substantial effects on the level of unmet social care need and propose that such models may help policymakers to compare alternative containment policies, taking into account their side efects on the social care provision process.

Rather, we propose this framework as a tool allowing the policymakers to better assess the effects of the pandemic’s containment policies on social care provided

We showed that the model could be used to evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of alternative policies, and can therefore represent an important decision-support tool for policymaking decisions in this complex and highly uncertain context. Te model results demonstrate that policy-makers have a trade-of to consider when imposing public health restrictions in these circumstances. When lighter restrictions are imposed, informal social care provision increases, as informal carers have more time available and are not restricted from providing care; however, under these conditions the negative outcomes of the pandemic are more modestly reduced

Models like this one could be used to investigate the nature and extent of these public health trade-ofs, so that policy-makers may make informed decisions based on the current state of the pandemic.

In both cases, the simulations allow us to assess the extent to which social care supply is affected and to take into account these effects in the assessment of the overall desirability of these policy, in comparison to other policies",Yes, United Kingdom,Considered and self initiated,"Agents have reactionary behavior when one household member is infected, the rest of the household behavior changes.

In line with the current understanding of care need progression, we assume that agents who develop a condition requiring care do not recover, but instead progress to higher levels of severity and care need over time.

We therefore assume that large amounts of unmet care need increase frailty. As for childcare need, we assume that all children, with the exception of newborns, have identical childcare need, requiring 10 hours of care each day.

In this model we assume that care receivers may only receive informal care if the provider is in the same town. We also assume that kinship distance restricts the provision of formal care; private paid-for care occurs only between members of the same household, or between parents and children.

We assume that childcare needs have priority over social care needs.

We assume that the agents can be concerned about two kinds of risk: • The risk of being infected, if susceptible or if unknowingly infected (e.g. asymptomatic agents). • The risk of infecting others, if knowingly infectious.

In line with empirical observations23, we assume that people of low social status have jobs with less inherent flexibility and are less able to work from home, compared to the jobs of people of high social status.

As for the knowingly infectious agents, who will be concerned about the risk of infecting others, we assume that their mobility reduction depends on their sensitivity to the share of the susceptible population S

We assume that the extent to which the infected agent’s mobility is reduced depends on its symptoms severity index, π

We assume that the probability of being infected by the care receiver or the care supplier depends on the contagiousness of the infected agent, on the duration of the interaction and, if the person carrying the virus is the care receiver, on whether the person knows about their infection status.

Limitations (simplification keyword):
Being this work a proof-of-concept, the framework presented in this paper contains many simplifications as our purpose was not to provide a complete model to make accurate forecasts but rather to develop a minimal model focusing on the interdependence between the pandemic dynamics and the informal social care provision process. Therefore, we included a ‘minimal’ model of the Covid-19 spread, which we aim to extend in future works. For this reason, We did not include, at this stage, important factors affecting the pandemic dynamics, such as the environmental and the institutional context, and we restricted our analysis to the stage of the pandemic prior to the introduction of vaccines. In addition, we did not include the effects of common interventions such as face coverings.

We can see that, under a lockdown policy which allows freedom of movement for social care purposes (which is, among the policies we considered in these simulations, the one which most resemble the policy adopted by the UK government), the empirical shares of hospital admissions by age, as reported in14, are within the 95% confidence interval for all the age groups, except for the 0-19 age group, which appears to be at the lower limit of the confidence interval (note, however, that there is a slight discrepancy between the grouping of14, where the first age group is the 0–17 group, and the grouping of the simulations’ outcomes, where the first age group is the 0–19 group. If we consider that the hospitalization rate increases with age, the empirical shares are higher for the 0–19 group and lower for the 20-39 group than they appear in Fig. 1).

Typically, the results of ABM simulations depend on many parameters which are characterized by a high degree on uncertainty.

The effect of the knowledge of infection on the behaviour within the household and during the care provision (φ) is the second most important parameter, determining about 33% of the total variance of the outcome. The other-regarding preferences (affecting the behavior of knowingly infected people) and the parameters affecting social network size and structure appear to have a marginal role in driving the outcome we considered."

More specifically, every agent is characterized by the following attributes: ID, province of residence, age group, social interaction ratio, number of contacts, current infection phase. A bit defines if the subject uses a protective device during the lockdown

People are modeled according to their social interaction de gree, which can be different from the others’. They can be iden tified by their Sociability Rate (SR), that admits four different values: high, medium, low and quarantine

This distinction has an impact on the definition of behaviors: we suppose that generic positive will be quarantined to prevent the infection spread, while an infected patient may be asymp tomatic and unaware of her/his condition and lead a normal life with its typical number of social interactions

In our model, when the simulation starts, we define which subjects will use a mask during the Lockdown and which ones will not",Stay at home; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft),"We simulated the epidemic scenario from January to April 2020 and from August to December 2020, modeling the government’s lockdown policies and people’s mask wearing habits

Participants were asked to fill out a diary that documented their physical and non-physical contacts in a single day. Physical contacts included interactions such as a kiss or a handshake. Non-physical contacts were situations such as a two-way conversation without skin-to-skin contact. Participants detailed the location and duration of each contact

Moreover, we collected data indicating what percentage of the population used protective devices. [39] and their effectiveness [40].

We assume that a generic agent represents a node in the social graph and its outgoing and incoming edges represent the contacts had by the node and the contacts of other nodes with it, respectively.

In a typical power-law distribution, nodes with a relatively high degree are more likely to form. This last assumption makes the power law suitable for shaping our social network

To describe the pathogen spread dynamics, we have assumed that a subject can move through various phases when he/she contracts the disease

Data Analysis and Modeling Unit, Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Torino",No,,Validation,"To evaluate our model, we finally used the results of the seroprevalence survey conducted in that same period in
Lombardy.

In order to evaluate our simulator and the social interactions model, we considered as a use-case the two Covid-19 outbreaks in Lombardy (Italy) during 2020. In particular, we were mainly interested in modeling the first wave from January to April 2020. Successively, the second wave (August-December 2020) was taken in consideration to validate the model and its parameters.

In order to validate our Covid-19 model we compared with different SEIR models we already presented in Section II. The comparison is presented in Fig. 12. ",Yes,"To estimate the sociability rate, the attention is focused on the distribution degree of the graph generated by the social interactions

To analyze the distribution, we have referred to the state of the art of curve fitting [42], using the Likelihood Ratio test and the Kolmgorov-Smirnov distance to determine which probability distribution is compatible with our data, looking for a power law distribution. We have chosen the Complementary Cumulative Density Function (CCDF), because CCDFs are often preferable for visualizing a heavy-tailed distribution. A CCDF measures the probability that a certain node’s degree is greater than a reference variable x (see (2))

The population includes 20% of agents having a high and a medium degree, as opposed to the remaining 80% of agents that have a low degree. To achieve this distribution, we have introduced three different social interaction multipliers that scale the number of people met in a generic simulation day. The multiplier for people having a medium degree is equal to 1. To estimate the remaining multipliers we have performed a grid search over the parameters looking for the optimal combination, i.e., one that returns a power-law distribution with a scale-free property II. The multiplier’s range for SR=low is [0.1-0.9] while, for SR=high, it is [1.1-1.9]. The particular case of quarantine will be detailed later.

In order to choose the optimal configuration, we have analyzed three different parameters: – LR (Likelihood-Ratio) test: This test compares two can didate distributions. The result is positive if the data are more similar to the first distribution and is negative if the data are more similar to the second one. The significance degree of the result (p-value) refers to the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same. – KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test. This tool measures the distance between a candidate distribution and the empirical data. In our case, it is used to compare a sample with our reference distribution, that is a power law. Hence, in light of the results in Table II, we have decided to use the configuration 0.2 - 1 - 1.8. This set of multipliers is suitable because it returns the highest likelihood ratio and, in particular, a power-law exponent α equal to 2.64, with xmin equal to 4. A distribution is called scale-free if α < 3

Finally, the difference between Infected and Positive is fundamental for analyzing the epidemic dynamics, especially during the first wave, when the possibility of testing large amounts of people was limited. This has probably introduced relevant estimation errors in the actual number of infected people into the official data

To model the lockdown condition, we have relied upon the information shown in Table I.

Modeling this situation is not trivial, thus we decided to model the contagion with a transmission probability that is related and specific to the virus, named Covid-19 Transmission Probability (CTV). This choice is common in several modeling approaches. However, currently, in the literature there are no references to this parameter. In light of this, we decided to estimate this parameter empirically through a data-driven approach that will be further described in Section VII-B

Finally, the contagion happens by randomly sampling from a uniform distribution considering the Contagion probability and actor A’s susceptibility.

We estimated Covid-19 transmission probability with a random search over the probability space with a data-driven procedure. We estimated this value in two different scenarios

The transmission probability parameter is a positive real number that ranges between 0 and 1.

The simulation result is a random process, therefore an average over five runs was computed for every value we tested.

For each case, we assessed the simulation quality using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the root mean square error (RMSE) between simulated data and real data from the Italian government [32]. The Pearson correlation coefficient expresses a linear relationship between two statistical variables. This value ranges from −1 to 1, where 1 corresponds to a strong positive linear correlation and −1 corresponds to a strong negative linear correlation. In our case, it explains how much the simulated contagion curve trend is similar to the real one. The RMSE, instead, is the average over all samples of the squared error between the predicted values and those observed in the real data

The values of the Pearson correlation coefficient and RMSE referred to Fig. 6 until April 30th are 0.992 for Pearson correlation and 38818 for the RMSE

We have already highlighted that, most likely, the data gathered in the first epidemic wave were inaccurate because the country found itself in a situation that it was not able to manage. Moreover, there was no contagion tracking system nor was a number of throat swabs suitable for correctly tracking infections available. Instead, when the second wave hit Italy, there was a larger availability of tools needed to face and analyze the epidemiological data more correctly

The values obtained greatly underestimated the actual data. Fig. 7 compares the simulated data (red curve) and the actual data (blue curve). In this case, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.988 and the RMSE 27415. Due to the large estimation error, we decided to estimate again the transmission probability parameter, using the autumn data. We searched for a value that correctly followed the contagion curve in the previously specified time period. The best value that satisfied our hypothesis was 0.53 (Fig. 8). In this final case, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.996 while the RMSE was 6405.

Seroprevalence analysis is much more reliable than the data collected during the months of March and April, because it also takes into account asymptomatic people, which is a very crucial factor. We believe that the matching data confirm the validity of our hypothesis and of our simulation model. Considering the cumulative curves in Fig. 9, for the comparison between the simulated and real data, the Pearson correlation coeffcient is 0.996 and the RMSE is 249529. In the comparison between the simulated and serological data the Pearson correlation coefficient is again 0.996, while the RMSE is 56009.

We then simulated the spring case again with different TP values: 0.1, 0.3, 0.53 (equal to our model) to ensure a fair search of the TP parameter. Every outcome was averaged over five tests. Considering the cumulative curves in Fig. 11 and the data reported in Table IV, we can assert that our power-law based approach to social modeling gives an important contribution to model the Covid-19 spread since it is more reliable both in terms of RMSE and Pearson correlation coefficient considering the Serological real data.

After the virus is recognized, at each time t, we assume that each infected agent and those who have come into contact with them have a probability P(test)=0.5 to perform a virus recognition test [32]. Therefore, half of them do not perform the test and continue to move inside the model space becoming, if infected, a symptomatic infected agent or an asymptomatic infected one. 

Recovered agents develop antibodies to the virus (ie, they become immune). 

Strengths and Limitations

There are a number of limitations that need to be mentioned. The main point concerns the input data for the model. We have retrieved the values from the most reliable sites among those that provide daily information about the spread of the virus, but this information is constantly evolving. Consequently, to keep the model updated, it is necessary to set up the most recent information. In this paper, the model photographs the situation at the end of June 2020, and it provides a forecast based on those data. Another limitation is that we considered only a small sample (which can be thought of as an infection outbreak). Even if this sample has the same national characteristics, the obtained results may not perfectly be the same when translated on a larger scale; that said, what we have obtained remains valid when studying a representative outbreak.

The data in all the simulations is based on official statistics, as they are obtained through the national statistical databases of each country. This is a major strength for Sweden, Germany, and Italy, but a limitation for the analyses relating to Brazil.

Imposed:
Agents have rules for their behavior, behavior chosen at random based on rules, assumptions, 

Imposed Text:
Second, the behaviour of each (bounded rational) agent is described by “rules of thumb” which are not necessarily optimal

Infected agents can be either non-symptomatic or symptomatic. The former are infected agents who do not have symptoms or develop only mild symptoms. In this case, the infection can be detected only if the agent is subjected to a random test. Detected non-symptomatic infected agents are quarantined and, therefore, cannot spread the disease. By assumption, all symptomatic infected agents develop serious symptoms and are detected with certainty. 

In addition to voluntary social distancing, there may also be a one-off government mandated lockdown. We assume that the lockdown is imposed when the number of detected weekly new infections reaches an exogenous threshold and remains in force for 12 weeks unless new infections decrease below another threshold prior to this

In each week, a number of eligible (susceptible, recovered and undetected infected) individuals corresponding to the coverage rate times the initial population are drawn randomly for vaccination according to probabilities defining the prioritization strategy. In the simulations shown below, we explore three prioritization strategies

For the moment, we assume that all agents accept to get vaccinated when they receive an offer.

All scenarios involving vaccines shown up to this point were conducted under the assumption that, once a vaccine becomes available, every agent accepts to be vaccinated as soon as they receive an offer

In particular, we re-run the scenario of Variant 2 without improved vaccine (VR2-OV) for a total of ten times. In each batch of 100 runs, we increase the share of agents who refuse the vaccine from the baseline of 0 up to 100% in steps of size 10%, with those agents refusing the vaccine being randomly chosen from the population.

In each period, every undetected infected agent may be detected with a probability πr τ which, as explained in the main text, becomes endogenous as the epidemic progresses. Agents who test positive are quarantined and therefore cannot spread the disease. People who develop serious symptoms are detected and quarantined with certainty.

In each period, we draw a random number nh from a uniform distribution U(0,1)for each agent, and if πd τ > nh, the agent will engage in social distancing.

We assume that the lockdown is enforced only once. In other words, if a lockdown has been imposed and subsequently lifted, there are no subsequent lockdowns even if detected infections rise beyond the threshold again in future periods.

Self-initiated:
Agents have utility behavior by being persuaded by actions of connected agents that might represent peer pressure, agents have incentives for specific health behaviors, which would represent utility based behaviors.

Infected agents can be either non-symptomatic or symptomatic. The former are infected agents who do not have symptoms or develop only mild symptoms. In this case, the infection can be detected only if the agent is subjected to a random test. Detected non-symptomatic infected agents are quarantined and, therefore, cannot spread the disease. By assumption, all symptomatic infected agents develop serious symptoms and are detected with certainty. 

Social distancing is described by a binary choice model. The probability that an agent will engage in social distancing is increasing in the number of currently infected and detected individuals (relative to a fixed threshold value) and the share of other agents who are already distancing, and decreasing in the perceived cost of social distancing. Every time an agent engages in social distancing, three effects occur. Firstly an encounter between a susceptible and an infected individual– which would otherwise lead to an infection with certainty– does so only with probability 1 − β if one of the agents is distancing and 1 − 2β if both agents are.

In addition, an upper bound is placed on the number of social and shopping connections which persist during the lockdown and the lockdown lowers agents’ perceived cost of keeping the social distance, making it more likely that an agent will engage in social distancing. Finally, we assume that the lockdown is associated with an increased effort to detect infections. Accordingly, once the lockdown begins, the probability of detecting an infected asymptomatic agent becomes a function of the number of cases detected in the previous week

The first is a measure of the severity of the epidemic, given by Dc,τ −Dc,SD where Dc,τ is the number of currently infected and detected individuals and Dc,SD is a fixed threshold value. The second captures social influence and is given by φd −φnd, that is the difference between the share of agents which are already socially distancing (φd) and those who are not (φnd). The third is a perceived cost of social distancing, denoted by cSD which is multiplied by −1.

After the lockdown, each firm moves out of smart working after a stochastic number of periods. Encounters between agents slowly adjust back to their previous level, as does the perceived cost of social distancing",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Social distance (6ft); Get medical treatment; Get tested;  lockdown,"In this case the infection can be detected only if the agent is subjected to a random test. Detected non-symptomatic infected agents are quarantined and therefore cannot spread the disease.

Each of these potential new infections leads to an actual new infection with a baseline probability equal to 1, but this probability may be reduced if i) one or both agents involved in the respective connection engages in social distancing as described in Section 3 and/or ii) if the susceptible agent is vaccinated as described in Section 4.

In the scenario we consider, two features may mitigate the spread of the disease: the adoption of voluntary/spontaneous social distancing by private agents, and the implementation of a one-off government-mandated lockdown.

Similarly, let Dτ denote the cumulative number of detected infections, with  ̇ Dτ , Dc,τ and Dc,τ having the equivalent interpretations of the variables defined above.

We assume that variants alter the epidemiological scenario by reducing the effectiveness of the original vaccine in preventing infections and/or serious symptoms and by increasing the transmissibility of the disease.

For simplicity we assume that only workers can become ill.

All old agents are assumed to be retired and hence economically inactive.

Moreover, the firm owners are assumed to jointly own the bank and consequently each receives an equal share of the dividends distributed by the bank.

We assume that a C-firm may carry out investment in any given period with a probability π k < 1.

The quantity adjustment rule departs from the one adopted by C-firms to take into account the assumption that K-goods are durable and therefore storable.

We assume that K-firms are endowed with a linear production function with labor as the only input.

We assume that all issued bonds are purchased by the bank at a fixed interest rate.

We assume that the government uses this amount to spend on the output of both K-firms and C-firms.

If a firms’ equity becomes negative, it is assumed to go bankrupt and exit.4

By assumption, all symptomatic infected agents develop serious symptoms and are detected with certainty.

For simplicity, we assume that the infected remain contagious for the entire duration of the illness.

We list all possible connections between the customers of a given firm in a given period and assume that a fixed share of those encounters actually take place (not all customers visit the firm at the same time).

While the shopping and employment networks evolve dynamically as agents’ employers and the firms at which they shop change over time, the social network is assumed to be static. We assume that each agent meets all their connected agents in every week.

We assume that a fraction (the basic transmission rate) of the number of connections in week τ which involves exactly one infected and one susceptible agent may lead to a new infection. By assumption, the different types of connections have different probabilities of being drawn, being highest for social connections, second highest for workplace connections and lowest for market connections. The basic transmission rate is assumed to be seasonal, being higher during autumn and winter months in the Northern hemisphere (October to April) and lower during late spring and summer (May to September).

We assume that both the effect of age and of excess demand for healthcare on the probability of dying decrease over time until they reach a lower bound as the healthcare system is partly able to adapt to dealing with the novel disease even in the absence of a vaccine (e.g. through the use of existing or new medicines other than vaccines, or simply through increased experience in treating the new disease (Ledford 2020).

We assume that the lockdown is imposed when the number of detected weekly new infections reaches an exogenous threshold and remains in force for 12 weeks unless new infections decrease below another threshold prior to this.

Finally, we assume that the lockdown is associated with an increased effort to detect infections.

We assume, however, that agents may continue to engage in voluntary social distancing.

Lagged adjustment of social and workplace connections following the lockdown as well as the remaining effects of voluntary social distancing are then able to contain new infections at a low level for some time until gradual relaxation together with the assumed seasonality of the base transmission rate lead to the emergence of a second wave. Since we assume that there is no second lockdown, and since the number of people who have acquired natural immunity through infection is quite low (due to the first lockdown), this second wave is more severe than the first.7

By assumption, during the lockdown one third of all L-firms are shut down and cease to produce.

In the vaccination scenario we assume that 11 months after the outbreak of the epidemic (roughly corresponding to the actual start of the vaccination campaign in Italy), a vaccine against the epidemic disease becomes available.

We assume that the vaccine immediately unfolds the above-described effects in a vaccinated individual for a number of weeks (vaccine-induced immunity) drawn from a normal distribution8 after which the individual becomes as susceptible to infection and serious disease as they were previously and needs to be vaccinated again.

We assume that the coverage rate, i.e., the share of the initial population which can be vaccinated in each week, starts at a low level (0.01) and then increases linearly by 0.001 in each week until reaching a level of 0.05.

For the moment, we assume that all agents accept to get vaccinated when they receive an offer.

We assume that both variants feature a sizable increase in the basic transmission rate relative to the original virus and that the seasonality of the transmission rate is less pronounced for the variants.10 and that they both reduce the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing infections by 75%.

We assume in parallel that the vaccine may be adapted over time to be as effective against the variant as the original vaccine was against the original virus, in which case agents need to be re-vaccinated with the new vaccine.

A variant is introduced in the model by assuming that a few weeks before the start of the original vaccination campaign, a small number of highly connected undetected infected individuals have their infection status exogenously changed from the original virus to the variant, which they then spread among their network of contacts.11

We assume that the transmission rate of any variant is 0.105 (October to April) and 0.095 (May to September).

While the endogenous emergence of variants is undoubtedly an appealing feature of a macro-epidemiological model, the exogeneity assumption is justified in our context because of the focus on a single region, Lombardy, within the context of a worldwide pandemic (indeed, all relevant variants of the SARS-COV2 virus discovered to date are held to have originated outside of Lombardy).

In scenario VR1-NV the new vaccine by assumption becomes available 6 months after the emergence of the variant.

As explained previously, variant 1 by assumption does not reduce the original vaccine’s effectiveness at preventing serious disease.

All scenarios involving vaccines shown up to this point were conducted under the assumption that, once a vaccine becomes available, every agent accepts to be vaccinated as soon as they receive an offer.

Moreover, the firm owners are assumed to jointly own the representative bank and consequently each firm owner receives an equal share of the dividends distributed by the bank

We assume that cb is a decreasing function of the (average) price of B-goods relative to L-goods.13

In this case we assume that the consumer will first spend up to cbCh,t on B-goods and then allocate any remaining liquidity to the consumption of luxury goods.

We assume that the firm charges a price as close as possible to the average price and sets a quantity as close as possible to (expected) demand.

By assumption C-goods are not storable.

We also assume that the firm will never set a price lower than its average cost.

Technology is represented by a Leontief production function, giving the maximum output the firm can produce in t: ̂ Y f ,t = min(αN N f ,t ,αK K f ,t ) where αN and αK represent labor and capital productivity respectively, which are assumed constant.

Moreover we assume that C-firms may invest in each period with a probability π k.

We assume, moreover, that the firm plans to maintain, in the long run, a capital stock buffer.

We assume that C-firms assess the financing gap (and the demand for loans) before accessing the market for capital goods.

For simplicity we assume there is only one bank which collects deposits from firms and households, supplies credit to firms and purchases government bonds.

We assume the bank sets the new credit line in order to equate the expected loss on loans extended to the f -th firm to the tolerance level

If the liabilities of a firm exceed its assets (so that its equity turns negative), it is assumed to go bankrupt and exit.16

Regarding the bank, we assume that if its equity becomes negative due to losses on bad debt, a bail-in procedure will immediately be applied: all firm-owners (who collectively own the bank) make a transfer to the bank to make its equity positive again.

We assume this expenditure is used to purchase both C-goods and K-goods and translates one for one into a supply of healthcare services to the population via the public healthcare system.

For simplicity, we assume that all government bonds are purchased by the bank at the fixed risk-free rate r.

We assume that economic decisions are taken every month while the health component of the model runs at a weekly frequency.

We assume that, in any given week, a healthy agent may catch a non-infectious disease with a certain probability πi.

This assumption implies that the non-infectious disease is endemic. For simplicity we assume that only workers (both active and inactive) may get ill with the non-infectious or the epidemic disease (described below).

For simplicity we assume that agents do not age, i.e. they remain in the age-segment to which they are assigned.

Old people are inactive by assumption and receive pensions.

For simplicity, we assume that the infected remain contagious for the entire duration of the illness.

We assume that both π ̂m τ and h3,τ decrease over time even in the absence of a vaccine until they reach a lower bound. A rationale for this assumption is that even without a vaccine, healthcare systems may over time become better at treating a novel disease (in the case of Covid-19 this may involve the use of existing or new medicines other than vaccines, increasing experience as to when patients should be intubated, etc.).

We list all possible connections between the customers of a given firm and assume that a fixed share ( 1 3 ) of those encounters actually take place (reflecting the assumption that not all customers visit the firm at the same time).

We assume that each infected and undetected agent meets all the agents they are connected to (at work, while shopping and during leisure time) in every week.

We assume that only a fraction (the transmission rate) of these connections may lead to a new infection.

We assume that there are no bequests, such that the assets of dead agents are simply written off.

By assumption, social distancing has three important effects on both the economic and the epidemiological dimensions of the model.

By assumption, with social distancing a meeting between an infectious agent i and a susceptible agent j generates an infection with probability

We assume that the first time any agent socially distances, their demand for L-goods (resp. B-goods) receives a negative (positive) shock.

Finally, we assume that the process of contraction of the consumption basket and change of its composition is gradually fading away.

We assume that the lockdown is enforced only once.

In addition, we assume that the lockdown lowers the perceived cost of social distancing, making it more likely, ceteris paribus, that any individual agent will engage in social distancing.

We assume that the lockdown is associated with an increased effort to detect infections.

To capture this feature, we assume that when an infectious agent i meets a susceptible agent who has received the vaccine v, the probability π tr i,v that i will transmit the disease to v is reduced by VE1 and set VE1 = 0.8.

We assume that if an individual belonging to this subset is vaccinated, they will develop serious symptoms only with probability π h v = 1 − VE2 and set VE2 = 0.95

We assume the worst case scenario of vaccinated infected individuals being as infectious as unvaccinated ones: VE3 = 0.24 We assume that a single dose of the vaccine provides the levels of immunity given above, for a duration which (in weeks) is given by a random draw from a normal distribution with mean equal to 52.25

In the simulations, in order to replicate the actual time-line in Italy, we assume that the vaccine is introduced 11 months after the outbreak of the epidemic (corresponding to December 2020) – i.e., well after the end of the first lockdown. We also assume that the coverage begins at a low level (0.01) and then increases by 0.001 in every period until reaching an upper bound (0.05).

Since all the old are inactive by assumption – the labor force consisting only of young and middle aged agents – in PW the probabilities are given by πin v = exp(1) exp(1) + exp(3) for the inactive (old) and by πac v = exp(3) exp(1) + exp(3) for the active (young and middle-aged actives have the same probability of being drawn for vaccination).

We assume that both variants are more contagious than the original virus but do not affect mortality: their transmission rate ρc is 50% higher and the effectiveness of social distancing β is 75% lower than for the original virus; the fatality rate, π m, instead, is not affected by the emergence of the variant.

Starting from the PA scenario (i.e. an epidemic with subsequent introduction of a vaccine against the original virus, with priority given to old agents), the variant is introduced in the model by assuming that a small number of “super-spreaders” are exogenously infected with the variant a few weeks before the start of the vaccination campaign.

In each batch of 100 runs, we increase the share of agents who refuse the vaccine from the baseline of 0 up to 100% in steps of size 10%, with those agents refusing the vaccine being randomly chosen from the population.

19 Appendix D contains a sensitivity analysis on the mean value 52.

Table 2 shows the empirical statistics we obtain as well as 95% confidence intervals (in parentheses) which we generate using bootstrapping.

The model is simulated 100 times with different seeds for a duration of 756 periods, equivalent to 63 years.

The simulated moments are shown in Table 3 as means across Monte Carlo runs along with the associated confidence intervals.

As in the previous experiments, we run the model 100 times with different random seeds and compute the mean values with 95% confidence intervals for each time period.

In this appendix, we present some additional computational experiments, the first one of which may be of interest from a policy perspective, with the latter two serving as sensitivity analyses on two of the most important parameters of the epidemiological sub-model.

As a mean value of 52 may be regarded as somewhat high, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by re-running the EP scenario shown in Section 3, i.e. a setting with an epidemic and an endogenous lockdown but no vaccination and no virus mutation, with the values 39, 26 and 13 for this parameter.

Figure 17 shows that while the number of deaths does not appear to be particularly sensitive to the choice of this parameter, it does have considerable effects on the number of infections, especially following the second wave of the epidemic, with subsequent waves increasing both in terms of length and magnitude, particularly for low values of the parameter.

We hence conduct a similar sensitivity analysis to the one shown in the previous sub-section.

We run the model 100 times with different seeds for each vaccination strategy and in every simulation month we calculate the mean deviation from the EP scenario (along with confidence intervals), as described in Section 3, for GDP and the government debt to GDP ratio."

The value of PI con assumes three values P1 con, P2 con, and P3 con.

In light of this rule, it is assumed that a non-infected person ai may contract an infection ((Sd(ai) = 1) with a probability that relies on the characteristics of ai.

Then, agent ai assumes the value of quarantine status Sd(ai) = −1.

The agent-based model involves all elements, such as parameters, elements, and assumptions, that represent the re-opening policy.

Assuming that n represents the number of candidate solutions and maxiter refers to the maximum number of iterations invested by the WOA method, the method has a computational complexity of O(n2 + 2 · n · maxiter).

The suggested approach, in contrast to existing agent-based models, considers actual assumptions when designing its rules, such as the importance of asymptomatic or immunized members in the transmission process and the impact of external infections.

Cases for Vaccinated Individuals These agents were treated in the same way as recovered ones. However, we assumed a lower probability of them becoming infected or being hospitalised.

We also assumed that in more severe cases, people would be hospitalised. In both cases, the agents spent at least three weeks there. However, agents who had contact with an infected individual were quarantined only with a given probability. The quarantine period was a minimum of two weeks. At the same time, no additional restrictions were assumed by the regulator.

We assumed that the duration of a lockdown would be at least two months (the lockdown was relatively long).

As a result of the adopted calibration, the steady-state unemployment rate was approximately 4.8%.

Following the analysis of the empirical data concerning the behaviour of capital during the pandemic, we decided to slightly recalibrate the parameters concerning the capital accumulation fk = 12 and d = 0.0175 (compared to fk = 8 and d = 0.05 in [1]).

Because the model was calibrated in weekly terms, the parameters of the Taylor rule also had to be adjusted.

While the personal friends network affects agent self-isolation propensity, after this has been formed at a first, individual, level, through agent tendency to adjust behaviour towards the mean of the network, the households network affects the formation of individual self-isolation propensity itself, by allowing agents to observe the occurrence of pandemic events and, therefore, providing them with the information they use to develop their subjective probabilities of these events.

During the pandemic, the number of people attending venues decreases as people become aware that interaction with other people carries a risk of them getting the virus and, as a consequence, they self-isolate. We assume that agent self-isolation rate is the result of an individual assessment of the risks and of social processes happening through their social network and their household membership.

However, we assume that an agent’s subjective perception of these probabilities diverges from the true (i.e., empirical) values, as agents process information from two other sources that they can observe in each period: the total number of events within an agent’s age group, and the events an agent can directly observe within their household’s social network. As for the former, the general idea is that agents adjust their subjective probability incrementally towards a value that is a biased measure of the empirical probability.

This assumption was made, as the risk of reinfection early in the pandemic was low [28], and the model was initially designed to look at short term outcomes of the pandemic (i.e., during a single wave).

In this cross-validation experiment, we are not aiming to compare the results to real data, which is done later in the validation, but to show that the assumptions we made to scale the model do not impact the output.

Limitations
There are a number of limitations of our model. No model is an exact replica of real life, and all models make assumptions. Some of the assumptions we have made should be considered when analyzing the results of the model.

Another limitation is in our generated contact networks.

While we think these data are an OK approximation for Irish contact patterns, we are introducing some uncertainty into the model with this assumption.

The model was also created with the idea of looking at the short-term impacts of behavior changes or other interventions, so some assumptions, including assumptions around reinfections, were chosen with this in mind. This will likely impact the outcomes of the model if run for longer terms and for periods of the pandemic beyond 2020; thus, these assumptions would need to be adjusted.

Model Validation
The model presented in the previous sections is a scaled version of the Irish county agent-based model [20]. Although it is based off a previously validated model, we made fundamental changes to the society component of the model with the introduction of the scaling factor and altered the level of detail in the environmental component. Thus, it is necessary to validate the new scaled-up version of the model. To validate the model, we follow the framework laid out in [33]. Agent-based model validation has three main steps: cross validation, where we compare the model output to a previously validated model, sensitivity analysis, and comparing model output to real data.

2.2.1. Cross Validation
The first step of validating an agent-based model is using cross validation, where the model output is compared to the output from a previously validated model.

Thus, the county model is a good benchmark for cross validation because it serves as the base model that was scaled up to obtain the scaled Irish country model.

We present the results from model validation and show that the scaling factor increases the variability in the model output, but the average model results are similar in scaled and un-scaled models of the same population, and the scaled model is able to accurately simulate the number of cases per day in Ireland during the autumn of 2020.

After cross validation, the next step to validate an agent-based model is to compare the output of the model to real data.

The first set of results presented are from a validation experiment designed to show the validity of the model.

3.1. Validation
In the following sections, we discuss the results from the experiments run for each part of the agent-based model validation framework (cross validation, sensitivity analysis, and comparison to data).

As the model output changes as expected, with the lowest number of new cases corresponding to the largest reduction in movements and then cases increasing as the agents level of movements increases, the model is considered validated through sensitivity analysis.

However, based on the comparison between the average simulated cases and the real case counts and that the real cases are within the confidence intervals produced by the agent-based model we can consider that the model is validated through comparison to real data when there are 100 or more cases per day.

In this paper, the model is validated off 2020 data, and we test the model on an example where initial conditions surrounding the model are based off of cases in 2020.

2.2.2. Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine if changes in the model inputs impact the model output as expected. In our sensitivity analysis, we look at changes in agent behavior and determine how increased community mixing impacts the number of infectious agents.

For the sensitivity analysis, we run four different scenarios, looking at how changes in agent movement impact the model results.",Yes,"For both the county model and the scaled model, we run the model 30 times.

2.2.2. Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine if changes in the model inputs impact the model output as expected. In our sensitivity analysis, we look at changes in agent behavior and determine how increased community mixing impacts the number of infectious agents.

For the sensitivity analysis, we run four different scenarios, looking at how changes in agent movement impact the model results.

We perform 30 runs of two scenarios of the model that focus on the period of time when schools reopen in the autumn: (1) schools re-open and community mixing remains the same at a 50% lower rate of mixing than pre-pandemic levels (2) schools re-open and when schools reopen community mixing returns to pre-pandemic levels.

Figure 5 also shows the confidence intervals around the average new cases per day. Although the average number of new cases per day matches closely with the real cases, the confidence intervals are relatively wide at the peaks.

While we think these data are an OK approximation for Irish contact patterns, we are introducing some uncertainty into the model with this assumption. Model uncertainty is also introduced in the choice of parameters determining the dynamics of COVID-19.

Upper and lower bounds of confidence intervals for the average simulated new cases are represented in blue dashed lines."
192,Silva 2023,The role of regular asymptomatic testing in reducing the impact of a COVID-19 wave,Consensus,Yes,"Our work aims to explore variations on such a policy, against the background of the existing symptomatic testing and tracing programme, using an adaptation of a published agent-based model called Covasim (Kerr et al., 2021).",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",No,,Yes, United Kingdom,Considered and imposed,"We assume a vaccination coverage scenario where 90% of people aged over 40 have been vaccinated with 2 doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine and 45% of people aged under 40 have been vaccinated with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. This leads to approximately 67% of the population being vaccinated, which at the time we started this work, was considered a high vaccination coverage scenario, but it is likely to be underestimating population coverage at the time of writing.

To take this into account, we implement isolation on symptom-onset with an adherence parameter, the probability that someone will preemptively isolate when they have developed symptoms.

Instead of asking contacts of a diagnosed positive case to quarantine, they are asked to take a PCR test, which they do with probability controlled by an uptake parameter.

To study the impact of increasing asymptomatic testing, we vary the percentage of the population in the regular testing cohort from 0% to 100%, in intervals of 10%. We also vary the frequency of testing, with the regular groups testing once per week, twice per week or every two days. The intermittent testers have a daily probability of testing of 1/28, 1/14 and 1/7, respectively, meaning that they will test on average once a month, once every two weeks or once per week. In this set of simulations, we fix the adherence to isolation on symptom-onset, the daily probability of testing if symptomatic and the proportion of contacts that take up a PCR test to 40%.

To represent these interventions in Covasim, we randomly remove a percentage of edges in the work, school and community layers of the contact network (i.e. not the household network). We vary the percentage of edges we remove from the network in increments of 5%, from 0% to 100%.

We also explore how sensitive our model is to changes in the parameters that control adherence to isolation on symptoms, daily probability of testing if symptomatic and the proportion of contacts that take up a PCR. We vary these parameters in increments of 20% from 0% to 100%.

A proportion of contacts of the diagnosed individual are notified as contacts. The proportion of contacts and the time it takes to find them depends on the contact layer that the contact occurred in: in the household layer, we assume that all contacts are found within the same day of diagnosis; in the school and work layers, we assume that 45% of contacts are found the day after the diagnosis; finally, in the community layer, we assume that only 15% of contacts are found, taking 2 days from the case’s test result to do so.

In the symptomatic case, people with symptoms for COVID or ILI have a fixed probability of testing every day. Those who test positive are placed in at-home isolation for 10 days, regardless of their isolation status prior to the test. In the asymptomatic case, we split the population into three groups: regular testers, intermittent testers and people who never test. Regular testers follow government advice rigorously, testing at periodic intervals. The rest of the population is split into 10% of people who never test if they are asymptomatic, and 90% intermittent testers, who test at a quarter of the rate of the regular testers.",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Social distance (6ft); Get tested;  contact tracing,"2.3. Interventions
We modelled government policy in our simulation setup through the inclusion of four interventions: vaccination; isolation on symptom-onset; testing; and contact tracing.

Government policy such as social distancing and sector closure (‘lockdowns’) were introduced to prevent transmission of COVID by reducing the number of contacts each person makes. To represent these interventions in Covasim, we randomly remove a percentage of edges in the work, school and community layers of the contact network (i.e. not the household network).",No,,,,,,,,,,,,No,Covasim Python package,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
As such, we find it necessary to take the simplifying assumption that the infectiousness of agents depends solely on their infectious age.

We assume a vaccination coverage scenario where 90% of people aged over 40 have been vaccinated with 2 doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine and 45% of people aged under 40 have been vaccinated with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine.

We also assume that the whole population is vaccinated from day 0, so the decaying vaccine efficacy resulting from decaying neutralizing antibodies is the same for all age groups. 

The proportion of contacts and the time it takes to find them depends on the contact layer that the contact occurred in: in the household layer, we assume that all contacts are found within the same day of diagnosis; in the school and work layers, we assume that 45% of contacts are found the day after the diagnosis; finally, in the community layer, we assume that only 15% of contacts are found, taking 2 days from the case’s test result to do so.

If we assume testing but no isolation on symptoms (only after a positive test) and no contact tracing, testing can reduce the number of cases from 10.6% (at a growth rate of 0.025) to 51.6% (at a growth rate of 0.15). However, if we assume perfect adherence to isolation on symptoms, the impact of testing depends on the adherence to testing after being contact traced.

In fact, our assumptions about the percentage of contacts found through contact tracing are conservative according to estimates from UK NHS Test and Trace (GOV.UK, 2022b), so the effectiveness of the combination of symptomatic testing and contact tracing could be higher than the results of our simulations, especially considering that achieving higher adherence to these policies is easier than high adherence to preemptive isolation.

Limitations
Our work has some limitations. Firstly, Covasim is a stochastic model and the inherent stochasticity gives rise to uncertainty in addition to uncertainty from the model parameters.

Secondly, in this study and when using Covasim in general, while most of the parameters are derived from the literature, there are gaps where we had to make assumptions. For example, for the asymptomatic experiments, we assumed 40% background symptomatic testing, adherence to isolation on symptoms and adherence to testing after contact tracing. Although this assumption is based on the results of the symptomatic experiments, it is unclear the extent to which the amount of symptomatic testing affects the efficacy of asymptomatic testing. Another assumption in the asymptomatic experiments is how much asymptomatic testing people outside the regular testing cohort should perform.

Similarly, while we have made an effort to quantify vaccine efficacy against onward transmission of different variants and waning protection from both vaccination and infection, current data is not definitive about these. Specifically, the version of Covasim used in this study assumed a single variant (albeit with different step-like change in transmissibility) and a single antibody waning function for all individuals and all types of immunity, with individual- and immune-level variation in the level of Neutralising Antibodies (NAbs).

In this model, it is assumed that an individual carrying the infection will be infectious and will cause others to be infected. Otherwise, the individual will remain susceptible. Furthermore, it is assumed that infection is not possible upon exposure to objects or locations previously used or passed by an infective person.

Limitations:

The model used in this study comes with several limitations. To determine the true occurrence of spread in a school setting, it is not sufficient to just look at the dynamics of the infection inside the walls of a classroom. Student to student interactions can also happen inside libraries, cafeterias, and other common school grounds. Also, the assumption that only the radial distance from an infected individual causes the spread does not fully uncover the true dynamics of the disease. We also did not incorporate in the model the possibility that the infection is non-linearly related with the exposure time [25] details that infectious dosage may be represented by a logistic function. In our simulations, we only considered exposure once the students have settled to their respective seats, and disregarded their arrival rate and the likelihood that students may take random paths from the entrance to their seats.

Limitations (limitation, challenging)
The limitation of this study is that it used secondary data such as epidemiological parameters and other store and customer information collected from records of a National Centre and the store itself. Therefore, the developed model was not updated with other parameters, especially those related to the worst time of the pandemic. As a result, all findings presented in this study are from a simulation of secondary store data and should not be generalisable to other settings. In addition, studying the behaviour of different samples of customers in terms of their adherence to NPIs on different days was also risky and prohibited by the store’s management. This might lead the model to suggest better/worse outcomes than the ones observed in a faced pandemic situation. Furthermore, validation of study results was impossible given the lack of real-time data on the number of exposed individuals exiting the studied supermarket.

Description of vaccination scenarios:

COVAM uses cell-phone mobility data and calibration to estimate a time-dependent adherence to NPIs and implements it explicitly by adjusting the number of contacts per person each day [7–9]. For instance, a 70% adherence level to NPIs in Dane County and Milwaukee is implemented by simply reducing the number of daily contacts from 10 per day to 3 per day per person, which slows the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. COVAM uses adherence to NPIs to model several distinct behaviors to mitigate transmission, including mask wearing and reduced number of interactions where individuals do not maintain a 6-feet distance during person-to-person interactions, and estimate future burden of COVID-19.

We also considered that only a proportion of the population agrees to be vaccinated, and there is a daily capacity for vaccination as a function of the proportion of the population in the community.

Our base case scenario assumed that vaccination starts on January 5, 2021; daily vaccination capacity is 0.25% of the population per day (i.e., 1,350 people/day in Dane County, 4,065 people/day in Milwaukee, and 21,680 people/day in NYC); there is a 20% drop in adherence among vaccinated individuals; vaccine effectiveness is 90%; vaccination coverage is 50%; and the baseline test rate is 75%.",Get vaccinated; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Get tested;  reduce number of interactions,"We evaluated the impact of vaccination considering the proportion of the population vaccinated, probability that a vaccinated individual gains immunity, vaccination capacity, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions.

We used observed adherence levels until February 1, 2021 and assumed that adherence levels after this date are maintained afterwards. The adherence scenarios in Table 1 are based on the new cases and the adherence levels observed in these regions since the beginning of the pandemic (S1 Table in S1 Data).

We selected these daily numbers of confirmed cases based on data from Dane County that employs 180 contact tracers to trace COVID-19 cases; therefore, 20 new cases per day would make it feasible to conduct aggressive and efficient contact tracing to completely control the disease in Dane County [14].",,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
COVAM also assumes that individuals who are experienced a previous COVID19 infection gain protective immunity for future infections.

However, cell-phone-based data and several studies have shown that the response of local communities to NPIs changed over time; therefore, the assumption of a fixed adherence level may not be realistic [7–10].

We assumed that some individuals undergo vaccination and as a result may gain protective immunity and become non-susceptible after vaccination representing the vaccine effectiveness rate. We assumed that individuals who gain protective immunity after vaccination cannot get infected with COVID-19 and do not transmit the disease to others.

Instead, we assumed that immunization is developed 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine is administered for the two-dose vaccines.

In all runs, we assumed that vaccination started on January 5, 2021, as the first vaccine was administered on December 14, 2020 in the US [13].

We used observed adherence levels until February 1, 2021 and assumed that adherence levels after this date are maintained afterwards.

Our base case scenario assumed that vaccination starts on January 5, 2021; daily vaccination capacity is 0.25% of the population per day (i.e., 1,350 people/day in Dane County, 4,065 people/day in Milwaukee, and 21,680 people/day in NYC); there is a 20% drop in adherence among vaccinated individuals; vaccine effectiveness is 90%; vaccination coverage is 50%; and the baseline test rate is 75%.

However, these herd immunity levels assume that NPIs, including face mask use, are no longer adopted.

Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a parametric sensitivity analysis in which we tested the impact of uncertainty in two input parameters: drop in adherence to NPIs after vaccination, where the drop in adherence was assumed to be 0% as opposed to 20% in the base case, and baseline test rate, where the probability of testing in earlier days of the pandemic was assumed to be 50% as opposed to 75% in the base case. We also conducted a structural sensitivity analysis in which we assumed that vaccination reduces the risk of infection instead of leading to complete immunity. 

Assuming vaccine effectiveness is 90%, vaccine coverage is 50%, and daily vaccination capacity is 0.25%, we found that the level of adherence to NPIs had a major impact on the cumulative number of cases (Fig 2 and Table 2), as well as the controllable spread date.

Limitations
Our study has several limitations related to uncertainty in vaccine effectiveness in real-world settings. Authorized COVID-19 vaccines to date have demonstrated high efficacy for preventing COVID-19 illness and hospitalization [3]. COVAM assumes that vaccination also prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, studies to determine the effect of vaccination on acquisition and shedding of SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing. Our model also assumes that COVID-19 vaccines will be effective in preventing transmission of new and future variants of the virus. The B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) variants have all been detected in the US [22], and all contain mutations in the spike protein. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are believed to be effective against the B.1.1.7 variant [23–25]. However, a recent study suggests the neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination are less potent against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants invitro [26]. As long as SARS-CoV-2 is replicating at high levels, new variants can be expected to emerge, underscoring the importance of high-level adherence to NPIs and rapid vaccination with high-level coverage. Furthermore, we do not use a full calibration procedure that is commonly used in simulation modeling to estimate the unobservable inputs of the model, which may have led to suboptimal set of inputs [27–29]. Finally, our model does not consider age-based differences in the administration and effectiveness of the vaccines. However, currently used vaccines are administered for individuals over ages 16 only. It is unknown if vaccination of  individuals younger than 16 of age will begin by the end of the study’s simulation period or if the effectiveness will be different for younger individuals.",No,,Yes,"The objective of this study was to use our previously developed COVID-19 agent-based simulation model [2], to examine the impact of vaccine coverage and effectiveness, vaccination capacity, and adherence to NPIs on SARS-CoV-2 burden, as well as to predict how these factors influence control of virus spread in urban communities in the US.

We previously developed the COVID-19 Agent-based simulation Model (COVAM) [2] to represent the interactions among people that may lead to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in three urban regions in the US: Dane County in Wisconsin, the Milwaukee metro area in Wisconsin, and New York City (NYC).",Three or more different disciplines,"Engineering, Life Sciences, Industry","Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences","1 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America

Sensitivity analysis section
We conducted a parametric sensitivity analysis in which we tested the impact of uncertainty in two input parameters: drop in adherence to NPIs after vaccination, where the drop in adherence was assumed to be 0% as opposed to 20% in the base case, and baseline test rate, where the probability of testing in earlier days of the pandemic was assumed to be 50% as opposed to 75% in the base case. We also conducted a structural sensitivity analysis in which we assumed that vaccination reduces the risk of infection instead of leading to complete immunity. That is, a 90% vaccine effectiveness scenario reduces the risk of getting infected among all vaccinated individuals by 90% but does not lead to complete immunity.

We found that the total number of confirmed cases was not sensitive to the vaccination coverage in any of the regions as long as communities keep ahigh level of adherence to NPIs.

COVAM accurately predicted the reported number of cases in each urban area in the short term (S2 Fig in S1 Data). We first reported the number of confirmed cases over time for different vaccine coverage and adherence to NPI scenarios when vaccine effectiveness is 90% and daily vaccination capacity is 0.25% (Fig 1).

To reflect the high level of adherence of the NI population to NPIs, we assumed that as soon as the agents develop clinical infection they go into isolation where they cannot be involved in any kind of interaction with others (i.e. cannot pass infection to
others nor be contacted by other infectious agents), and hence it was specified that  for all. This implies that in our simulations we assume that the infection is transmitted only via agents who developed either preclinical or subclinical infection.

The true number of these agents at the beginning of simulation is unknown so we used calibration to define how many agents needs to be initialised at the cells with status IP and IS.

Also in this paper, we use standard genetic algorithms for the purpose of the ABM component’s hyperparameters calibration and in the future we wish to explore other optimisation strategies to investigate whether they would lead to obtaining faster results.

3.1. Calibration and validation
For the purpose of the ABM component calibration we utilised the standard generational genetic algorithm (GA) [43] with population size 50, 15% mutation rate and 85% crossover rate, using tournament selection with tournament size 2.

This is accompanied by a detailed description of the entire calibration and validation process, as well as interpretations of the fitted parameters.

Genetic algorithms were used for calibration purposes to ensure that the exact infection dynamics patterns can be replicated by the CP-ABM. This was validated through the existing literature.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the only one that fully calibrates their model using a number of different methods from visual inspection of the fit of the predicted to the observed data for the ICU admissions, bed occupancy and mortality (both daily and cumulative) to an evaluation of the resulting R² and Pearson’s R estimates, ranging between 0.87 and 0.93.

In order to ensure that the ABM component is producing realistic patterns, deeming it fit for purpose, the patterns in its output had to agree with the patterns in the observed dataset, which is validated against several different criteria.

Following the validation of the model, we can focus our attention on the other ABM input parameters that have been estimated by the GA algorithm.

There are no clear guidelines on the base relative infectiousness of people with developed subclinical infection, however given that the model has proven to validate well against several different criteria and that the estimated PE→IS is in line with the findings reported in the literature, we estimate that their baseline relative infectiousness rIS b is 39%.

This can be achieved by setting the behavioural parameter corresponding to the time interval b(153,206] to 0, and running a series of 50 ABM component simulations for the 206 ticks, using the same random number generator seeds as the ones used by the GA with the best solution (a choice made for the reproducibility reasons).

In the state transition resulting from the decision process, testing and treatment resources are required. If sufficient testing resources are available, all asymptomatic uninfected, asymptomatic infected, and mildly infected individuals will be tested and moved to their corresponding post-identification states.

It is assumed that the total population of the region remains constant during this period, which is a reasonable assumption for short and medium-term planning. However, it should be noted that for long-term planning purposes, assuming a static total population due to permanent migration may no longer hold true.

We assumed that all infectious airborne pathogens eventually get recirculated but allow different filtration rates to be set as a parameter in the model. Therefore, circulated air contains a fraction of quanta that is far away from the infectious source. 

There is limited literature on how long a recovered person is immune to reinfection and so we conservatively assumed that the recovered student remained immune throughout the semester.

We assumed that the teacher is not con­tagious in the initial state. 

3.2.1. Class schedule and duration, surveillance testing and contact tracing

For the sake of simplicity, we assumed that students are seated 6 ft apart and the IVRR is 1.87 (h− 1). 

In order to model surveillance testing with contact tracing, we assumed that testing was performed on a weekly basis for a random sample of ten percent of the students. 

Since being in a closed environment was one of the fundamental assumptions of the model, we only traced individuals in contact with the infected agent within the classroom. 


Limitations

It is important to mention that there are several limitations to this study. First and foremost, the data for parameter estimation is still somewhat limited. Although it is easy to perform sensitivity analysis over a range of values, we decided to rely on current information and focused on assessing different policies against the spread of COVID-19 in a comparative manner. In addition, we assumed randomized seating in a classroom and did not study the impact of entrance/exit/movement of the agents. This could be extended by developing a hybrid model using network and phase transition analysis. Finally, we did not explicitly consider the cost of interventions in our model which can be a topic of study using methods such as cost-benefit analysis.

The approach can help architects, managers, or the 
government better understand the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce the 
infection risk and improve the level of indoor safety.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an indoor infection risk assessment 
method that can integrate multiple transmission routes, and can quickly predict the infection risk in buildings with frequent movement

As this project was designed to guide the decision-making authorities in Austria, we established a Standing Policy and Expert Panel TAV-COVID (SPEP TAV-COVID), including 13 national and international experts from different disciplines and institutions. 

We aim to provide evidence-based guidance to the authorities in order to minimize COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths in Austria.

The aim of the study was to inform health policy decision makers and authorities, in a manner, that strategies related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines are evidence-based. Therefore, the members of the expert panel were informed about preliminary result as soon as of 17 November 2020, and results were communicated to the respective committees and authorities to be considered when developing and announcing the Austrian vaccination strategy.

In the model, infected individuals can be either detected based on specific COVID-19-related symptoms or testing, or they remain undetected and could become infectious.

We considered sterilizing and non-sterilizing immunity, assuming a 70% effectiveness.

Disease severity is assumed to be dependent on age and comorbidities [28] (see Appendix A Tables A3 and A4).

For all simulations, it was assumed that other protective measures against SARS-CoV-2 spread already implemented before the start of vaccination are maintained during the 6 month analytic time horizon of the analysis.

In all simulations, we conservatively assumed a vaccination effectiveness of 70% for individuals younger than 65 years and a reduced effectiveness of 60% for individuals 65 years of age and older. This assumption on vaccine effectiveness was based on expert opinions considering early trial results, the expectation that various vaccines with different effectiveness levels would be approved, and the fact that effectiveness in real-world applications might be somewhat lower than in the trials due to the selected patient population.

For vaccines inducing sterilizing immunity, we assumed that 70% of the vaccinated persons are protected against infection (60% for individuals 65 years of age).

At the start of the modeling time frame, we assumed an initially limited number of vaccine doses, sufficient to fully vaccinate 200,000 individuals.

We also assumed that protective immunity will last for at least 6 months after vaccination.

Assuming availability of a non-sterilizing vaccine for approximately 2.5 million individuals, vaccinating the elderly followed by vulnerable persons avoids approximately one third of deaths and hospitalizations when compared to no vaccination over a 6 month time horizon.

It must be emphasized that these results assume that other protective measures against infectious events (e.g., face masks, distancing, and hygiene) are still maintained.

Our Standing Policy and Expert Panel guided the project in defining upfront relevant optimization criteria in the Austrian context, potential target group categories, and further assumptions including participation rates as well as interpretations and communication of results.

All of the results assume that other protective measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are maintained.

Analysis assumed a vaccine effectiveness of 70% in the general population and of 60% in the age group 65+.

4.4. Limitations of the Study
As all modeling studies, our study has several major limitations. First, the analyses generally do not account for the negative effects of COVID-19-related HCW absenteeism on the outcomes presented. Second, contact behavior and the likelihood of infection of HCW were modeled according to the general population, which may not fully capture specific infection risk in healthcare settings.

Third, for vulnerable groups, age-specific distributions of risk factors were partially taken from German surveys, which however, likely do not differ substantially from the Austrian context. Fourth, contact behavior of vulnerable groups was modeled according to the general population.

Fifth, we did not consider logistics and time required for vaccination; that is, we assumed individuals are vaccinated more or less at the same time. Although this simplification has no major impact on the selection of the prioritization strategies, the level of effect of the vaccination differs when accounting for substantial delays in vaccine delivery. Sixth, we applied a conservative assumption for vaccination effectiveness of 70% in the general population.

Our results are in line with other modeling studies, although comparability to other simulation studies is limited. Differences in modeling studies include the modeling approach, assumed reproduction rates (R0), assumed sterilizing nature of vaccines, and country specific assumptions including demographics, distributions of comorbidities, or contact pattern.",No,,Yes,"To consider the simultaneous impact of hospitalizations, mortality and spread over time, we applied a previously published agent-based population model that is currently used to inform Austrian healthcare decision-making bodies [20–24].

Advice included the selection of target groups, analytic time-horizon, stepwise strategies, batch sizes, optimization criteria (outcomes), model structure, appropriateness of identified data and sources, parameter transformation for use in the models, analytic methods, and interpretation and communication of results and limitations, as well as the reporting needs for Austrian policy and decision makers.

Both the entry–exit mechanism and the ownership structure of firms in the model are purposely kept very simple: exiting firms are immediately replaced one-for-one by newly entering ones and each firm is assumed to be privately owned by a single individual who, in the case of illiquidity, is liable to make up any negative balances up to the total of their financial wealth.

By assumption the dead are not replaced by newly born agents, hence there will be no bequests. When agents die, their assets are simply written off.

The household’s desired consumption (corresponding to Friedman’s “permanent income”) is given by human wealth plus a fraction of accumulated financial wealth (which by assumption consists only of bank deposits)

Since gathering all the information on overall market conditions is, by assumption, diffcult and costly, consumers are unable to visit all the firms when deciding where to buy.

Since firms do not know the demand schedule for their output, they make use of two rules of thumb to set their price and desired production. In a given period, a firm’s information set consists of (i) the current relative price of its output and (ii) excess demand in the previous period. By assumption C-goods are not storable

We assume that during normal times (i.e., in the absence of an epidemic), a healthy agent may become ill with some probability in any period. Such an illness, however, is not lethal and the sick do not infect other agents. This state of illness is designed purely to generate a baseline level of demand for healthcare. For simplicity we assume that only workers (both active and inactive) may become ill. This assumption is also maintained when the epidemic is introduced

The employment rate initially spikes as active agents who fall ill become temporarily inactive, but then declines along with GDP. The decrease in activity is mainly driven by the decline of the population; as explained above, the UE scenario leads to a high number of deaths and by assumption, dead agents are not replaced. If an economically active agent dies, the potential aggregate output of the economy hence declines.

Limitations: 
Both the entry–exit mechanism and the ownership structure of firms in the model are purposely kept very simple: exiting firms are immediately replaced one-for-one by newly entering ones and each firm is assumed to be privately owned by a single individual who, in the case of illiquidity, is liable to make up any negative balances up to the total of their financial wealth. These assumptions of course imply limitations in the model’s ability to realistically depict ownership structures, bankruptcy, and firm entry dynamics.

The right panels of Figures 15 and 16 show the effects of the IS policy, whereby the government makes transfer payments to all worker households for a limited number of periods

Due to the limited information set of consumers regarding relative prices, the firm has some market power, enabling it to be a price setter. It knows from experience that if it charges higher prices it will tend to receive less demand but does not know the precise demand schedule for its output. 

The magnitude of the adjustment is stochastic. The upper bound of the support of ρp limits the admissible price change. We also assume that the firm will never set a price lower than the average cost.

The infected individuals go through 5 stages, of which the first two represent the first two days of being symptomatic whereas the last three represent the phase where the immune system is fighting the disease.

Toward this aim, we extended a mathematical model designed in our previous efforts,[23,34] a high-resolution ABM of a medium-sized US town faithfully reproducing spatial layout, demographics, and lifestyles of urban areas, to quantify the effects of a range of vaccination and testing efforts.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",No,,Yes,United States,Considered and imposed,"In every simulation, only a fixed number of shots can be administered each day, in the form of booster or first shots, with no particular prioritization. For example, a rate of 20 vaccines per day implies that 20 randomly chosen, eligible agents will receive their vaccine dose that day, either their first or their booster shot, according to their vaccination status.

To quantify the impact of the vaccination rate on the spread of COVID-19, we performed simulations with two different rates: 0.58% and 0.11% of the total population per day.

In particular, we hypothesized that each symptomatic agent was tested with probability equal to 80%, while such a probability was reduced to 40% for asymptomatic agents.

We model local vaccine hesitancy using an upper bound on the vaccination coverage in the town. Specifically, no more than 64 364 people are considered as eligible for vaccination (≈81% of the population), computed as a projection based on the temporal evolution of the number of new vaccinations in New York State,[1,55] re-scaled to the population of New Rochelle.

We conducted a parametric study by varying the vaccination rate and the overall efficacy of testing practices over a 2-dimensional grid. Specifically, we considered re-vaccination rates ranging between 0.01% and 5% of the population per day.

The efficacy of the testing practices was encapsulated by a global parameter, termed “testing efficacy,” which measures the probability that a symptomatic agent is tested. In the simulations, we varied such a parameter from 10% to 100%, representing scattered to ideal testing.

Moreover, a predetermined number of co-workers is home isolated.

An initial number of vaccinated agents is also contemplated, based on the data collected from the vaccination campaign put in place between January 2021 and the start of the simulation. We assume that each of the 51 342 individuals already vaccinated at the beginning of the simulations has received their first shot in a randomly chosen day between the beginning of the vaccination campaign in January 2021 and September 7, 2021 (see the Supporting Information for the temporal distribution of first shots), resulting in different levels of immunity at the beginning of the simulations for these vaccinated agents.",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Get medical treatment; Get tested;  contact tracing,"For this projective study, we tailored the ABM to capture the scenario as of fall 2021, thereby introducing realistic and time-dependent vaccination effects, booster shots, increased mobility of fully vaccinated agents, and CDC-compliant contact-tracing measures.[14,47,]


Each resident of New Rochelle is mapped into an agent in the ABM, resulting in 7 9, 205 agents. In the ABM, agents are characterized by a health state that can change according to a disease progression model detailed in the following, and they can take two types of tests—safe, contact-less car tests, and more risky ones performed in a hospital. If infected, agents may undergo three types of treatment—home isolation, routine hospitalization, and hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU)


Upon infection, a susceptible agent becomes exposed (E), not showing symptoms of the disease. An exposed agent can also get
vaccinated (Ev) as long as their infection status is not known. Even
without any symptom, exposed agents can be tested and home

These two values correspond to the maximum first-dose vaccination rate attained at the beginning of April 2021 and the rate registered in early September 2021, respectively.[56]

The probability of being administered a given vaccine type was computed based on data collected manually on actual vaccine offered in the town, as of late July 2021, see Table S5, Supporting Information.[54]

We model local vaccine hesitancy using an upper bound on the vaccination coverage in the town. Specifically, no more than 64 364 people are considered as eligible for vaccination (≈81% of the population), computed as a projection based on the temporal evolution of the number of new vaccinations in New York State,[1,55] re-scaled to the population of New Rochelle.

Model parameters related to vaccinations and contact tracing are based on the literature and official releases from the CDC,[58] as detailed above. The characteristics of different vaccine types are based on official CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) releases[59–64] and are outlined in detail in the Supporting Information.

An initial number of vaccinated agents is also contemplated, based on the data collected from the vaccination campaign put in place between January 2021 and the start of the simulation. We assume that each of the 51 342 individuals already vaccinated at the beginning of the simulations has received their first shot in a randomly chosen day between the beginning of the vaccination campaign in January 2021 and September 7, 2021 (see the Supporting Information for the temporal distribution of first shots), resulting in different levels of immunity at the beginning of the simulations for these vaccinated agents.

For this projective study, we tailored the ABM to capture the scenario as of fall 2021, thereby introducing realistic and time-dependent vaccination effects, booster shots, increased mobility of fully vaccinated agents, and CDC-compliant contact-tracing measures.[14,47,48]

These parameters are representative of optimal testing practices,[65] and they are used to illustrate that, even under optimistic assumptions on the efficacy of testing practices, low vaccination rates may lead to tremendous increases in infections and death toll.

Due to the limited supervision on restrictions to private visits, we accounted for reduced compliance, estimating such a parameter from the literature, see Table S4, Supporting Information.

Per the original, August 2021 CDC guidelines, an agent was set to start losing their immunity at ≈8 months after they become fully vaccinated.[2]

Contact tracing is implemented in the model by complying with local guidelines,[14,47,48] in accordance to their stricter version issued in winter 2021.

This vaccination rate is not unreasonable, as it is comparable to the average vaccination rate during the peak of the spring 2021 vaccination campaign.[56]",,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Specifically, following Ferguson et al.,[49] we assumed that symptomatic individuals are twice as much likely to transmit the disease than asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals.

Here, we assume that such an immunity is totally lost over the course of the following 6 months.

Following the original CDC guidelines, we assume that people are eligible for booster shots starting from 8 months after their second vaccine dose.[2]

We assume that each of the 51 342 individuals already vaccinated at the beginning of the simulations has received their first shot in a randomly chosen day between the beginning of the vaccination campaign in January 2021 and September 7, 2021 (see the Supporting Information for the temporal distribution of first shots), resulting in different levels of immunity at the beginning of the simulations for these vaccinated agents.

The parameters used in our contact tracing practices are also listed in Table S4, Supporting Information, where our assumptions on the number of contacts each agent has in their workplaces, schools, and other visited locations, are detailed. The complete parameter set and all the modeling assumptions are detailed in Table S4, Supporting Information.

In our simulations, whose outcome is illustrated in Figure 3, we assumed that highly effective testing practices were enacted during the entire period. 

These parameters are representative of optimal testing practices,[65] and they are used to illustrate that, even under optimistic assumptions on the efficacy of testing practices, low vaccination rates may lead to tremendous increases in infections and death toll.

To support these insights, we performed additional simulations that demonstrate robustness of our findings with respect to different assumptions on the initial number of infected individuals.


Though calibrated in real data, the high granularity of our model comes at a cost of a series of assumptions.

Finally, in our ABM, we implemented vaccination assuming no prioritization based on age or between booster shots and first shots.

2.4. Parameters
For the relief system, the three relief types were mainly assumptions based on the experience during the food relief rollout in Davao City.

2.6.1. Movement dynamics
As stated in the overview, the assumption behind the relief system in this model is that people only move around for necessities. Therefore, each relief type allows movement to a certain degree of probability depending on the type initialized. The relief type values were determined through assumptions and observations during the food relief system rollout during ECQ in Davao City. 

In the model, it is assumed to be 0 to 1 or 0.5 every month for regular and sufficient food relief. For regular but insufficient food relief, it is 1, 2, or 1.5 times every week, due to the assumption that people would need to go out at least once a week. Finally, an irregular food relief distribution meant the highest
probability of moving out because supposedly people cannot depend on government assistance and will essentially look for ways to earn money for food, hence, people are assumed to go out around three times a week in this type of relief situation.

2.6.2. Epidemiological dynamics
These recovered residents will then cycle back immediately to a susceptible state.

It is noteworthy to mention that our study only explored a few possible scenarios limited only by specific NPIs that were implemented during ECQ in Davao City, but the model can be further extended to consider other scenarios, for instance, including other NPIs, as well as pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines. Further improvements, validation, and calibration can be done to the model to simulate COVID-19 infection in specific villages or even municipalities using its actual demographic and COVID-19 data. There is also limited data on the COVID-19 dynamics during the food relief distribution in the Philippines, and therefore the subject of interest, the food relief system, is a behavioral assumption based on the observations at the time of implementation.

A proportion of the population was assumed to attend a school (it may represent a kindergarten, an elementary school, high school, or a college) distributed in classrooms of 30 students with one teacher.

We assume that recovered individuals develop long-term immunity.

We assumed that a constant proportion of new cases are asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms and, therefore, are not detected for the public health system.

We assumed a conservative scenario where only a passive contact tracing is implemented.

These results strongly suggest that assuming ρ j = 1 for all j is a very unrealistic case.

Even in this case, the health system collapses assuming four beds per thousand population (Fig. 3), a relatively high value for most small to mid-size cities in non-developed countries.

In each of these environments, we assumed a constant risk of infection proportional to the number of infectious individuals in them.

Contact tracing and case isolation is assumed to be always implemented.

4.3 Limitations of the model section
It is important to remark that risk of transmission for each environment was kept constant in each simulation. However, those risks are likely to vary with time. Individual behavior may change according to risk perception, and workplaces and institutions may enforce different social distancing measures.

Loss of immunity and re-infection were two processes that we did not consider in the model.

We considered a homogeneous population, but age is a significant indicator for hospitalization.

Also, we assumed that individuals belonging to any households are randomly assigned to workplaces or schools.",No,,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Life Sciences, Industry","Computer science, Natural Resources and Conservation","Instituto de Investigaciones en Energía no Convencional (INENCO), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de Salta, Av.

All periods considered are random variables modeled with Gamma distributions with significant variance values. In other words, for each simulation, the values for the different waiting periods widely vary between individuals. The mean value of the latency period may produce a shift in the epidemic curves but not in the peaks. The duration of the infectious period may have a significant impact on the force of infection but in our case we fixed the value of the probability of transmission per contact and per unit of time from the data in the secondary attack rate. Changing the mean infectious period translates to a change in the probability of infection to leave the secondary attack rate unchanged

The percentage of asymptomatic cases, i.e., never experience symptoms, remains uncertain (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020) and there are different estimations with high variation ranging from 10% to 73% depending on what symptoms are included in the definition of the suspect case and when the patients were tested (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020; He et al. 2021; Poletti et al. 2020).

4.1 Population distribution, social structure and disease dynamics

How the population is distributed has a significant effect on the disease dynamics, as we show in Sect. 3.3.

When we considered that σh = 1/3, σa = 2/3 and the risk of transmission in workplaces equal to βW = 13βH (case 2), school closures were enough to prevent hospitalization satura-tion considering the household distribution observed in Tandil (mean = 2.81, variance = 2.49) and the homogeneous case (mean = 4, variance = 0). In the same situation, considering the household distribution observed in La Banda (mean = 3.94, variance = 4.21), it is necessary to close at least 25% of workplaces

Considering the population distribution and the personal routines described in the main text, the average time a person stays at home in a day is equal to 15 hours and 44 minutes (a proportion of 0.643). Thus, if the mean infectious period is equal to 7.5 days, then 4.825 days is the mean infectious period that a person remains at home. 

The infectious period of the index case was selected at random from a gamma distribution with mean 7.5 and variance 9

For the simulations a = 0.5(Liuetal.2020; Jingetal.2020) was considered, resulting in a H = 0.143732 according with the equation above.

To estimate λ, we must identify the period of time where the cumulative daily incidence has exponential growth and then fit an exponential function to these points. In our case, considering a free epidemic situation (scenario E1) with the parameters corresponding to case 1 (ρW = 1/2) we have the cumulative daily incidence shown in Fig. 10.

Fourth, the data about the target are, in most cases, based on assumptions and estimates. In this study, there is no data about the target regarding the impact of spatial behavior on pandemic propagation, and many ethical concerns stand in the way of constructing such data. Furthermore, accurate data on COVID-19 exact infection rates are not available, especially in a specific environment like this.

There are multiple limitations to the studies; the validation of the results is one of them. As with similar studies, human behavior follows a stochastic pattern that is extremely hard to replicate. Instead, the simulation follows a similar stochastic approach, making the results similar but not exact. Another limitation is that the research on COVID-19 is still ongoing, and while there is a large volume of available data, a large part of it is still experimental, and needs more research to confirm it. A third limitation is the need for more agent types to produce more accurate results, for example, school workers, administrators, and other types of personnel

We next assume reduction to 60% 180 days later [36], and following the booster dose (third dose), we assume increase back to 90% seven days after the vaccination [37].

In this work, for modeling the spread, we first used a “naïve” SIR model, which assumes homogeneous protection for all the population without age-based divisions.

To exemplify how this affects modeling, assume a theoretical case that the entire age group is vaccinated on Feb 1st.

As a result, effective reproduction rates should vary for each group based on vaccination rates (Fig. S2 C-D), despite the assumption that populations mix homogeneously, and everyone is susceptible to infection without vaccinations (Fig. S2 C-D).

First, we apply a naïve SIR model, assuming average protection of the total population (Fig. 1B).

Since vaccination dynamics were unknown then, we assumed similar dynamics, by age groups, as in the first vaccination campaign (Fig. 2A). We first applied the naïve SIR model to the whole population, assuming only the average protection for the whole population (Fig. 2B). As a result of the assumption that the un vaccinated population has a higher Re than that of the first outbreak, the number of daily confirmed cases was significantly overestimated.

Where Delta and Omicron differ significantly in their R0: here we assume that Omicron R0 is double of Delta’s R0 and in addition, we assume a shorter incubation time for Omicron (Table S3. A similar scenario happened later in February, where Omicron BA.1 was replaced by the BA.2 variant, again because of higher R0 (we assume here 50% higher R0 for BA.2 compared to BA.1) [45-47]. Using data on number of infected individuals that arrived in Israel in the first half of December (assuming all are Omicron) and number of confirmed cases in Israel in that time frame (assuming all are Delta), we attempted to predict the proportion of the variants in the next 30 days

We next used data collected up to January 11, 2022, to model the outbreak from then forward, for both SIR and MAM models, and predict daily confirmed cases under the assumption that from that day and on, Omicron is the dominant variant, which enable the use of the multi-age SIR model. Based on the data gathered up to the index date, we assumed here Rt = 2.5. In MAM, since there are competing variants, we also assumed that Omicron is twice as infectious as Delta.

We used MAM to compare how a reduction of 20% in Rt will affect the number of daily confirmed cases and, possibly more importantly, the number of daily active severe cases in hospitals in parallel, where number of daily active severe cases was calculated using the daily number of confirmed cases, assuming a 0.25% chance of a confirmed case to become a severe case with an average hospitalization time of 6 days [50].

Due to this, assuming uniform protection throughout the population is not sufficient to accurately model the disease’s spread. Therefore, we applied a multi-age approach using SIR and MAM. In this approach, each age group has its own characteristics based on vaccine effectiveness and vaccination rate and assuming homogenous mixing across the three age groups.",Yes,https://github.com/hdeleon1/MAM---Flexible-Monte-Carlo-Agent-based-Model-for-Modelling-COVID-19-Spread/,Yes,"Hunter et al. call for further work to expand the ABM for complex scenarios and apply it on real-world data.

In specific, applying these methods to the results of a prevalence study (SORA6) conducted in April 2020, we obtain a detection probability of 13% (CI 95% [2%, 86%])3. The second study (Statistics Austria7), performed during the second wave of COVID-19, indicates an increase of the detection probability to 35% (CI 95% [24%, 58%]). In our simulation model, we assumed these values to be characteristic for the corresponding epidemic wave.

To that end, we investigate a fictional, unconfined outbreak of the 
disease and compare simulation results with different initial immunization levels. That means, we assume no implementation of new NPIs, no change in the contact behavior or any other effects on epidemic progression besides decrease of the susceptible population.

Analogously, we assume that a distinct peak/maximum in the observed prevalence is attained at some point in time. 

Like all models on the total amount of infected persons also this 
work relies on international and national studies and analysis of not detected cases based on measured data. In addition we assumed that a past infection of SARS-COV-2 will always result in immunity long enough for the scope of this study (no loss of immunity). 

The results of this study are limited by general limitations of modeling and simulation based research including modeling simplifications and data quality. 

The data sources used for this study also have several limitations. Some of the randomized prevalence studies have been performed at a time with low case numbers (end of April 2020 and May 2020). Here, the sample size of 1432 and 1279, respectively, were not big enough to produce a significant outcome useful for further analyses.

process is specified as follows:

1.We specify the scenario as realistic as possible, exploiting all possibilities of the ABM to depict policies set by the government (e.g. quarantine, contact tracing, school closure,...). This way, a time-dependent seasonality-factor S(t) ∈ [0, 1] remains as the sole free parameter of the calibration, which essentially temporarily scales 
the contact-specific infection probability.

2. We define a vector t with tk = t0 + k�t, k ∈ {1, 2, ...} of event times. We define that the seasonality factor is constant between any two event times, i.e. S(t) ≡ Sk for t ∈ [tk−1, tk), and define finding the vector S with Sk, k ∈ {1, 2, ...} as the goal of the calibration process. Typically t = 14[d] is used, and t0 corresponds with the start time of the simulation.

3. We run the simulation on the time interval [t0, t0 + ξ ] and fit the value S0 with a bisection algorithm. Hereby, ξ = �t + 5[d] to consider, that changes in the infectiousness of the disease require about 5 days to become visible on the level of the detected cases. The target function of the calibration is the root-mean-squared-error of cumulative confirmed cases.

4. We fix the value found for S0 and continue calibrating with S1. We run the simulation in the interval [t0, t1 + ξ ]and fit S1 with a bisection method. This step is continued K-times until the simulation end-time tK + ξ of the calibration-step matches the end-time tend of the original simulation scenario.

During an outbreak, the HCWs expressing symptoms are tested, and certain fractions (f1; f2) of (I1; I2) are put in isolation, where they undergo their specific disease pathways, but do not mix and transmit the pathogen.

Using a novel individual-based modelling approach, we explored different scenarios for COVID-19 transmission and control in a non-COVID hospital unit.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
We modelled social mixing patterns by assuming that HCWs and ward patients interact on a daily basis via aggregating in random groups of HCWs, and via patient visitation by HCWs (see electronic supplementary material, appendix for details).

Here, we assume infected E-hosts can undergo three different pathways: (A) asymptomatic (E → R); (M) mild symptomatic (E → I1 → R); (S) severe symptomatic (E → I1 → I2 → R), with population fractions (νA; νM; νS).

Thus, our assumed quarantine fractions (0 < fi < 1) account for limited test sensitivity, and a possible overlap of ‘COVID-like’ symptoms, expressed by non-COVID hosts.

The likelihood for the observed data is assumed as a normal distribution with the centre at the predicted values from the IBM.

An increase in targeted isolation assumes more intensive screening or test sensitivity.

We assumed PPE provides 80% protection (via the reduced probability of transmission from an infected patient).

Limitations
The current model set-up is subject to some limitations. First, it was designed for a single hospital unit and simplified treatment of the patient pool, as the target group in our study was HCW pool.

Second, although we have made an effort to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a hospital setting, some parameters used in our set-up were drawn from general information sources, such as fractions of symptomatic mild and severe cases [37], disease stages and durations [38], and associated infectivity levels [39], which may be adjusted in the future work.",No,https://github.com/qimin-h/COVID-19-huang-et-al,No,,Two different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics","Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences, Applied mathematics, Mathematics (general), Statistics","1.

Convincing our stakeholders who sought to use the ABM for transparent decision-making to accept our ABM pre-diction results was challenging; in particular, it was difficult to justify why all agents should have the same probability of hospitalization when ample evidence contradicted this model assumption. To overcome this limitation, we demonstrate that a straightforward Bayesian method in the estimation of the model parameters can be used, which requires only aggregate data from NC hospitals and the age and comorbidity status of agents in the synthetic population underlying the ABM

Note that one limitation of the comorbidity assignments is that they were only estimated for three age ranges (0–49, 50–64, and 65+ years), with no agents under 50 being assigned comorbidities

A variety of limitations exist for this work. First, as discussed in Section 4, the specific Bayesian probabilities in this analysis should only be interpreted in the context of the NC synthetic population used in this project. Comorbidity status is only assigned to adults aged 50 and older in the synthetic population, and the comorbidity status assignment was based on health care-associated risk, which is slightly different from the one published by CDC for COVID-19 hospitalization [6,14]. A second limitation is that in this initial analysis, separate probabilities of age given hospitalization with COVID-19 and comorbidity status given hospitalization with COVID-19 were provided by NC DHHS. The calculation of the joint probability of age and comorbidity status gave hospitalization with COVID-19 assumed that the underlying probabilities were independent, an assumption that may not be true. In later versions of the ABM, we subsequently made updates to this calculation and used data that included the joint distribution of age and comorbidity status given hospitalization with COVID-19. A third limitation is that the calculations did not account for differences in specificity and sensitivity for different types of COVID-19 tests and may overestimate the quality of testing results. Finally, the assumption was made that although age impacted the likelihood of infection with COVID-19, neither age nor comorbidity status influenced the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test once infected with SARS-CoV-2

This hypothetical scenario is used only for the purposes of sensitivity testing and assumes a low effective R range (1–1.2).

One key difference is that the probability of hospitalization for agents for COVID-19 agents is expected to be higher among tested infections than untested infections. This is based on a comparison with the CDC overall estimate of probability of hospitalization, and the suggested estimate that untested infections larger in number than tested infections, particularly in the early months of the pandemic in 2020 when testing was limited. Another key difference is the joint probability of age and comorbidity status. These estimates were calculated from those agents estimated to have COVID-19 in the ABM. The ABM included a separate calculation of probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection through a SEIR model that accounted for differences in likelihood of infection by age.

Firstly, validation experiments are designed to calibrate the input parameters of artificial society and validate the evaluation model respectively. Secondly, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to test the influence of input parameters on the selected output indicator (e.g., R0, Tgen).

In the validation, the parameters of the disease spread model are shown in Table 7... Compared to the previous research, the value of three indicators are reasonable and the value of input parameters are determined. 

Then, we validate the accuracy of the evaluation model by comparing the GDP loss based on the evaluation model with the GDP loss based on the trend forecast. Firstly, we obtain the GDP loss based on the evaluation model by evaluating the real epidemic data of COVID-19 in the first 4 months of 2020. Secondly, we obtain the GDP loss based on the trend forecast by using the historical GDP data from 2016 to 2019. The difference between the two kinds of GDP loss is about 9.14%, indicating that the evaluation model is reliable.

Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the influence of input parameters on the selected indicators. We choose five parameters in the sensitivity analysis, including Pt, α, β, TE, and TIR. The sensitivity of the parameters is reflected by three indicators, including R0, Tgen and ˙C. We applied the elementary effects (EE) method proposed by Morris, (1991) to obtain sensitivity measures σi and μ*i (Canpolongo and Saltelli, 1997), and the results are concluded in Table 8.

Since we assumed that visitors are disallowed completely, residents’ risk for primary exposure is contact through staff who acquired an infection from the wider community.

Testing of residents in all scenarios assume that one resident per room is tested weekly, systematically cycling through the each resident every 3 weeks.

The baseline scenario assumed the CDC infection prevention and control recommendations for nursing homes, including visitor restrictions, daily symptom screening of residents and staff, use of face masks, and weekly testing of staff.

Parameters assumed for the baseline scenario are described on Table 1.

Results from our model were most evident when we assumed a larger probability of viral introduction.

Equal vaccine efficacy assume that the efficacy was the same for resident and staff agents, A refers to a vaccine efficacy according to the reported by [33], and B a vaccine efficacy reported by [34]

(12 results)

Testing in clinics or hospitals was assumed to be more risky as the odds of transmitting the virus was evidently higher.

The effect of second variant was investigated under different assumptions on its infectiousness relative to the base variant.

In the model, it was assumed that an individual cannot be simultaneously infected with both variants, so that if an individual contracted the base variant at time t (according to Equation (1)), then they cannot contract the new variant at the same time.

An agent in the model can be infected with only one variant (base or new variant ) of COVID-19 at a time, and, once infected, they may be tested and treated. Recovery from COVID-19 grants the agent a temporary immunity to the variant they were infected with; however, it had no effect on the probability of infection with the other variant.

In this study, an advanced phase of the pandemic was considered, in which vaccines had already been developed and made available to a wide portion of the population. For this reason, it was assumed that individuals had already made their choices on whether to take the vaccine shot or not and, those who decided to vaccinate, were already vaccinated at the moment of starting the simulations. Moreover, possible ongoing vaccination or booster campaigns that were implemented during the short-term simulation time-horizon were omitted. For a study that focused on this issue, a previous work was referred.[35] The number of vaccinated agents was determined from the reported data at the county level.[73] It was assumed that each vaccinated agent received the vaccine some time between January 1st 2021 and the start of the simulations, matching the actual time distribution of the vaccination campaign,[74] as detailed in the Supporting Information. It was also considered that part of the population received a booster shot.

In order to study the long-term evolution of multiple COVID-19 strains, we simulate its spread for a 1-year time-span in two distinct scenarios: one in which booster shots are ineffective and the new variant is quite infectious, and one in which we assume highly effective booster shots and a mild new variant. 

In both scenarios, we assume 50% protection loss and 50% testing efficacy loss. 

Limitations

While insightful and consistent with similar efforts, our results should be interpreted while keeping in mind several limitations of the model. First, following CDC recommendations,[63] we set the duration of immunity after recovery to 90 days. This estimate may be conservative, inevitably leading to several reinfections. Although not conclusive for Omicron, there are observations of immunity lasting two or even three times our estimate.[81,82] However, as shown in the additional simulations reported in the Supporting Information, even very optimistic assumptions on the duration of natural immunity would not yield contrasting conclusions to our study.

The second limitation concerns the limited amount of information about and the high levels of uncertainty on the efficacy of booster shots against variants and the rate at which the immunity wanes after taking the booster shot.[75,76,83] In our study, we partially address this issue by considering two extreme outcomes for the booster shot: a worst-case scenario, where booster shots do not provide any benefits, and a best-case scenario where, instead, they restore maximal and permanent immunity. Importantly, we observe that the results of our simulations remain consistent across these two extreme options, with booster shot playing a marginal role on the case count. As of July 2022, novel Omicron-adapted booster shots are being developed by different manufacturers.[84,85] The use of these booster shots, if efficacious, may steer the course of the pandemic. We would like to comment that, even though these booster shots are not currently considered in our model, the flexibility of our computational framework allows for their straightforward implementation, similar to vaccination and booster campaigns incorporated in our previous studies.[35]

Finally, our model does not consider cross-immunity, that is, recovery from an infection with one variant does not yield any natural protection against the other variant. Lack of cross-immunity is not an uncommon assumption in the literature,[41,42,51,52,55,56,58] as it can be viewed as a worst-case, conservative scenario, which is, however, not too distant from what is suspected with the most recent variants.[86–88]",Yes,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5659785,Yes,"Building on previous efforts, a computational framework was developed that included two components: a database of the town of New Rochelle and a high-resolution ABM that reproduced the spread of multiple variants of COVID-19.

The details on the database and creation of the synthetic population can be found in earlier works.[24,30,35]

In this work, we establish a novel high-resolution computational framework to study the spread of two COVID-19 variants: a scenario that is recurring globally. The framework is built upon our previous efforts,[24,30,35] expanding the ABM developed therein to reproduce and study the concurrent spread of two COVID-19 variants—an initially widely spread base variant and an emerging new variant.

Specifically, we consider different infectiousness of the new variant and effectiveness of booster shots, and we vary the protection loss and the testing efficacy loss in their entire range of admissible values. In these simulations, we focus on a shorter time period of 3 months starting from mid-April 2022, over which it is reasonable to assume that neither new variants appear nor updated booster shots campaigns are implemented. This enables us to derive quantitative estimations on the number of new infections under different scenarios and compare them.

In all the simulations included in this section, the natural immunity of the residents is set to 90 days, representing the conservative estimate provided by the CDC guidelines.[79] Such a choice could be considered as a worst-case scenario, and it could potentially lead to an overestimation of the number of reinfections. To investigate the impact of such a modeling choice on the output of our numerical study, we perform additional simulations in which the duration of natural immunity is extended to an optimistic estimate of 240 days, consistent with the longest estimate in the clinical literature.[80] The results of these additional simulations (reported in Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information) are consistent with the findings described herein and show only marginal differences in the total infection count.

For instance, we verified that the average exposition time and infection time obtained by our model agreed with the literature, see Table 2. Different scenarios considering only one of the two virus infection drivers (via contact or aerosol) were performed to identify the primary infection driver in the model.

Secondly, to evaluate the overall infection process, we decided to verify the accuracy of the basic reproduction number R0 estimated by our model.

To validate the logic describing the complex phenomena represented in the model, we analysed our model under extreme parameter configuration

However, during the model validation phase, we measured the predictive accuracy of our model comparing its outcomes with empirical data and results already reported in the literature. First, we validated the aerosol transmission in our model compared to that proposed in Gkantonas et al. (2021) reproducing the same settings in our ABM

Our findings are consistent with the literature. For instance, in the validation analysis, our model suggests that the viral transmission in the school environment is mainly due to the aerosolization of viral quanta as already suggested by other studies (Gkantonas et al. 2021). Furthermore, the estimated effects of mask-wearing and indoor ventilation is consistent with results found in other modelling studies (Chu et al. 2020)",Yes,"only the teacher being infected obtained by our model compared to that reported by Gkantonas et al.

More specifically, the red line and histogram represent the mean and empirical distribution of such a measure derived by 1000 simulation traces of our model, while the dashed blue line represents the mean computed in Gkantonas et al. (2021)

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, we did not find any other work studying R0 in a similar context, therefore we decided to compare our results with those proposed in Rocklöv et al. (2020) and Lai et al. (2021), in which the basic R0 is estimated considering the data generated by the COVID-19 outbreak in Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Of course, the environment and age of the populations in these two works are quite different, although we believe that similar remarks on R0 values could be applied in our model.Specifically, both these works strongly suggest the R0 of this disease in the enclosed areas should be higher compared with that estimated by the WHO ranging from 2 to 3. Indeed, both works report that an R0 between 2 and 3 would not be able to account for the soaring number of infection cases reported in the short period of the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Thus, these works using different modelling approaches estimated greater R0 values (i.e., ranging from 4 to 7 in Lai et al. 2021 and 15 in Rocklöv et al. 2020) justified by the fact that people in tightly enclosed environments can easier gather and enter into contact

Limitations (""difficult"")
The simulated results did not show clear influence of the physical-distancing measure for all the estimated indicators. At first sight, this measure seemed to reduce surface and food contamination. However, one should interpret these observed reductions with caution. It is worth remembering that,in this paper, the distancing measure was artificially implemented by varying the length of the conveyors in the plant. The contamination ratio for the inert surfaces and food by transfer was 
determined based on the total surface. Thus, a reduction in the contamination ratio while increasing the conveyor length might be associated not only with the effects of the measure but also with a “dilution” effect simply due to the implemented numerical formalization. 

All the constraints mentioned above might therefore explain the encountered difficulties in simulating and studying the effects of physical distancing on viral transmission.

Assumptions + Limitations (challenges)

The agent based models, due to their inherited complexity, incorporate separate individuals with multiple different characteristics and parameters per individual. This adds another layer of parameterization flexibility, but also introduces another layer of modeling challenges, since the number of individual’s characteristics within the model is determined by the modeler [18, 34–36]. This typically implies some additional assumptions about the model behavior and the overall model parametrization. Those assumptions are expected to be region-specific, since the transmission times, patterns, and other characteristics typically wary from region to region. The respiratory infections, which include SARS-CoV-2, add another level of complexity to any model due to quality of reported data. The asymptomatic cases are typically neither identified nor properly recorded and surveillance systems for symptomatic cases are never perfect either. As a result a substantial (but unknown) amount of cases is not reported and the modeler has to account for those asymptomatic and unreported symptomatic cases who still participate in the disease transmission process.",Yes,https://github.com/quantori/COVID19-MA-Transmission,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Life Sciences, Industry","Computer science, Health Sciences","Department of Population Health Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America

145,Douven 2023,Pandemics and flexible lockdowns: In praise of agent-based modeling,Consensus,Yes,"For the purposes of this paper, it would not really matter if the above assumptions turned out to be somewhat off, given that our primary goal is not model fitting or prediction but rather to make a methodological point: drawing attention to the practical value of agent-based modeling, and more specifically also drawing attention to how the combined use of agent-based modeling and evolutionary computing can help us deal with the current pandemic and possible future ones.

We make available a package for modeling the COVID-19 pandemic and similar pandemics and give an impression of what can be achieved with it. In particular, it is shown that by coupling an agent-based model to a standard optimizer we are able to identify strategies for implementing non-pharmacological interventions that flexibly lower or raise social activity, depending on how the outbreak develops, while balancing various desiderata that cannot be fully satisfied together.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",Yes,"As will be seen, the model has one central parameter, which specifies the extent to which the agents are socially active. We suppose that policymakers are able to manipulate this parameter, at least to some extent, and thereby to effectuate, and also ease, NPIs in a flexible manner. But exactly how they do this—how they translate data about the ongoing pandemic into policy decisions—depends on further parameters (i.e., hyperparameters), and the policymakers’ success depends on whether they are able to find a right combination of those other parameters. To help with that task, a standard multi-objective optimization algorithm can be coupled to the agent-based model.

Therefore, the Supplementary Materials for this paper contain a Julia package for creating models of the kind just described.5 Readers are encouraged to install the package and to experiment with it, as doing so should make it easy to appreciate how flexible the agent-based modeling approach is and how swiftly very detailed information about local properties of a population (e.g., about community structure) can be taken into account.

Using the Julia package in the Supplementary Materials, readers may want to run their own experiments with different graphs representing different assumptions about the community’s social structure.",No,,Considered and imposed,"Importantly, the weight parameter can be time-indexed, which enables us to model the effects of mitigation efforts; for instance, we can conceive shelter-in-place mandates as attempts to raise w and of the easing of such measures as attempts to lower w.

We propose to model such possible interventions generically, through manipulating the value of w (i.e., the probability that agents will skip a visit and stay home instead). Exactly what policies might be most effective to bring about such changes in actuality may differ from one country to another (e.g., depending on how compliant a population is) and even from one point in time to another (e.g., depending on whether earlier mitigation measures were perceived as overreactions by the public). Such implementation details are beyond the scope of this paper.

A straightforward approach to having intermittent NPIs is to switch, during the course of the pandemic, at regular time intervals between a “middling” (say, .5) and a “high” (say, .95) value of w until the worst is over (Ferguson et al. 2020; López and Rodó 2020; Westerhoff and Kolodkin 2020).

If agents stay home, then they may infect their home mates with the same probability with which they would otherwise have infected the agent or agents they would have visited, and the home mates may infect them with the same probability with which they may infect anyone else in their network.

Furthermore, we assume that 1 percent of the infected will eventually need critical care, which appears true at least for the first year of the pandemic (Clark et al. 2020).",Yes,"Furthermore, we assume that 1 percent of the infected will eventually need critical care, which appears true at least for the first year of the pandemic (Clark et al. 2020).

A straightforward approach to having intermittent NPIs is to switch, during the course of the pandemic, at regular time intervals between a “middling” (say, .5) and a “high” (say, .95) value of w until the worst is over (Ferguson et al. 2020; López and Rodó 2020; Westerhoff and Kolodkin 2020).",,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Julia,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"The basic setup is that every agent visits one node (household, gym, store, . . . ) per unit of time (a day, let us assume), where this node is chosen from the ones in their network.

We assume that every visit is “successful” in that whenever a household is visited, its members are present, and not out to visit other households.

To make this a model for studying the spread of COVID-19, we assume that agents are, at any given time, in one of three states: susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, infected by the virus, or recovered from the disease (which includes agents who have died from it). Furthermore, we make the following assumptions:
• at start time, 1 percent of the village population is infected, the rest being susceptible;
• the probability that a contact between an infected and a susceptible person results in an infection of the latter—the transmission rate τ—is 4 percent (Otto 2020);
• the maximum duration of the disease is 24 days, but half of the infected need only half that time to recover (Liu et al. 2020);
• the more seriously ill, who do not recover after 12 days, have in the remaining days of their disease a lowered transmission rate of 1 percent (Liu et al. 2020);
• the more seriously ill do not visit anyone, and their households are not visited by anyone;
• patients have a 1 percent chance of dying from the disease (Mizumoto and Chowell 2020; Russell et al. 2020)


It is obvious how to operationalize number of deaths directly due to the disease, given our assumption of a death rate of 1 percent among the infected. 

Raising the value of w diminishes social activity, but should we assume that economic activity scales linearly with social activity? Probably not. For instance, some companies were able to adapt to the new situation by moving part of their business to the Internet. For our purposes, however, it is enough to make the general assumption that the lower the average value of w over the course of the outbreak, the better it is for the economy.

We assume one ICU bed per 1000 persons, which is overly generous in light of the normal ICU capacity even in countries like Germany or the United States, which have the highest number of ICU beds per capita.

Furthermore, we assume that 1 percent of the infected will eventually need critical care, which appears true at least for the first year of the pandemic (Clark et al. 2020).

The above proposal assumes some size of the sliding window to be used for the local regressions, and it also assumes a particular size of factor (which we symbolized by s) to scale the impact of a measured regression coefficient on the adjustment of w. 

Our model made assumptions—such as household members always being present during an agent visit—which, although almost surely not completely accurate, could plausibly occur and are unlikely to significantly alter the outcomes.

And due to medical advances, the recovery rate may increase.
While this limitation can be overcome (López and Rodó 2020), the assumption of homogeneous mixing, which the model also makes, is more problematic.

We are free to choose values for these parameters, at least within limits (e.g., the value of s will in practice be limited by how fast and
drastically changes in the level of social activity can be effectuated even in an ideally compliant population).",Yes,https://github.com/IgorDouven/COVID.jl.,No,,One discipline,Social Sciences,History and philosophy of science and technology,IHPST / CNRS / Panthéon–Sorbonne University,No,,Verification,"We numerically verified that, given this setup, an agent has an average of 5.79 (± 2.91) contacts per day, which appears reasonable in light of the data about social mixing patterns reported in Klepac et al. (2020).",Yes,"This is a robust result: running 25 simulations for the same switching strategy yielded an average total undercapacity, calculated as explained above, of 354.58 (±8.03) and an average number of deaths directly due to COVID-19 equal to 179.64 (±13.06).

More exactly, five simulations of 150 updates are run per agent, using the agent’s proposed window size and scaling factor, and the agent receives three scores on that basis: the number of deaths, the total undercapacity, and the average w value, all averaged over the five simulations.

For a more informative comparison of the two settings, we ran 25 simulations for each."

Our model can be applied to mega-cities with more than ten million people and finish the computation within a few minutes just using the ordinary CPU.

And the hybrid simulation method combines ABM and SDM to save computational cost while keeping the spatial heterogeneity, so our model can be applied to large-scale data, while the pure ABM is almost impossible for the high computation overhead.

Our model can be modified for further research to study other social factors and intervention policies in the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics.

A future direction for this study could be conducting experiments of different interventions based on our model, such as restricting the traffic among the communities or quarantining the community with a confirmed case, etc. More factors influencing emotion could also be added into our model, e.g. the effects of media during the pandemic may be revealed using the multi layer network model.

We assumed that the neighbor was randomly chosen and as the time step of the simulation was one day, we assumed that the frequency of spreading was once a day.

Then we assume v and c follow a logarithmic function, with a linear weight wc.

We assumed that the concern level decreased uniformly by wd every day.

According to Wang et al. [32], we set r1 as 0.2, and we assumed r2 as 0.02.

Parameter assumption section
We list the assumptions in our model when conducting experiments on the actual data of the COVID-19 pandemic as follows. The infection rate β0 is0.05249 according to Yang et al. [33]. The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be between 2days and 14 days [34–36], so we assumed the incubation period 1 s complies with a triangle distribution ranging from 2to 14 with a vertex at 7. Similarly, we assumed the duration of infection 1 g complies with a triangle distribution ranging from 7to 28 with a vertex at 14. The initial susceptible population was set as the resident population and we assumed that there were 500 communities in a city, so the number of nodes in a network was set as 500. We assumed that the first exposed case appeared 7days before the first infected case confirmed and we set the number of initial exposed individuals as three. We assumed that people who recovered would not get infected again.

Limitations (shortages)
Our model still has some shortages. We only chose two kinds of information as the sources of the concern level, and in fact, the computation of emotion is much more complex and there may be some other factors. Besides, we did not adopt the real community distribution data so there may be differences with the actual situation.",No,,No,,One discipline,Computer and Information Sciences,Artificial intelligence,"Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",No,,Verification; Calibration; Sensitivity analysis; Validation,"We compared the calibrated emotional contagion parameters of different countries and found that the suppression effect of emotional contagion in China is relatively more visible than that in the US and the UK.

With calibration, the simulation results of our model were close to the actual data.

To verify the suppression effect, we conducted ablation experiments on the three cities in different countries, removing the emotional contagion layer while keeping all the rest parameters the same, shown as the dotted lines in Fig 4.

Sensitivity analysis section
We also conducted a series of sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changing emotional parameters on the simulation results. Take Guangzhou as an example, sensitivity analysis results of wn, wm and wc are shown in Fig 5. When keeping other parameters fixed, the increase of any of these three parameters would reduce the peak number of cases and flatten the curve. That the confirmed cases are sensitive to the emotional parameters also provides good evidence that the suppression effect of emotional contagion is notable and should be considered when modelling the epidemic.

This includes customer limits in stores, mandatory hygiene concepts at leisure facilities and reduced contacts with friends or family.

Once vaccines became widely available, Germany implemented the so-called ‘3G-Strategy’: vaccinated, recovered, or tested (Geimpft, Genesen, Getestet). Only individuals with a valid vaccination, proven recovery or recent test result may access leisure activities such as restaurants, sport events and similar. Towards Winter 2021, the strategy was narrowed down to the two variants ‘2G’, which no longer accepted unvaccinated and unrecovered individuals regardless of test results, as well as ‘2G Plus’ which required a recent test result on top of vaccination or recovery certificate. These strategies are also present in the SoSAD model, allowing to account for the effects of such strategies on the infection dynamics at leisure activities and workplaces.

In case of a positive result, either due to infection or a false positive, the student is quarantined.

In our model, we simulate tests with both a sensitivity and specificity of 90%.

Another method for estimating the total number of infected people is to compute the predictive values of the test, which depend on three elements: the prevalence of the epidemic, the rate of false positives (which is equal to 1 "" specificity, with specificity being the probability that a positive individual receives a positive test), and the rate of false negatives (equal to 1 "" sensitivity, since sensitivity is the probability that a negative individual receives a negative test) obtained with the test.



",Yes,"
We made a number of simplifications. In particular, even though we take into account the number of daily contacts of each agent, we do not specify who these contacts are.

Table 4. Comparing three strategies in terms of five indicators.

Similarly, if the screening campaign starts late (15% people symptomatic, bottom figures), even increasing the number of tests to nine per 2000 people (bottom right), we notice that the peak identification is very uncertain, and cases are strongly overestimated after the peak. When screening starts immediately and intensively, this overestimation only happens when the number of cases is very low (top right).

Limitations (bias, caution, challenging, caveat)
We acknowledge that a potential differential recall bias may exist between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases due to the self-reporting of symptoms as well as the fact that the data are generated for public health surveillance purposes (isolation of cases and quarantining of their contacts) and not for research purposes.

This potential bias may have partially affected our results. In addition, no data was collected on low-risk contacts (which were not placed into quarantine) and this could have had an effect on overestimating the SAR. Caution needs to therefore be taken to compare these estimates with other studies which might have used different definitions for at-risk individuals.

Social distancing: Also called physical distancing, this maintains enough space between people and avoids mass gatherings.

Transition from the initial states to the subsequent states depends on the assumptions of the spreading on a network summarized as the followings:
• Transmission from an infectious node to a susceptible node occurs across an edge
as a Poisson process with the infection rate, the virus-spread-chance.
• An infectious node recovers as a Poisson process with the recovery-chance.
• By depending on the gain-resistance-chance, transmission from a recovered node
to a susceptible node occurs across an edge as a Poisson process.

Limitations

One limitation of this work is that it generates a model with the population size 10,000. This is because of the limitations of our modeling environment. Although, this size is reasonable to assess the dynamics when considered the previous small-world cases as in [21], it is intrinsically true that higher population is better. Future work can address this issue as to be more realistic.

If other realistic factors affecting the spread of COVID-19 disease are identified, the number of factors to be considered in future studies can be increased.

In July 2021, the strategy was to vaccinate all adults (18+ years old) with one dose by 31 July 2021, and with a second dose within 12 weeks of the first.

During the third national lockdown children of key workers attended school, with estimates suggesting that around 20% of primary school students and 5% of secondary schools students were attending—an average of 14% of children [31]. For simplicity, we included this in the modelling framework by simulating transmission intensity at 14% of the expected level at full attendance between 4 January 2021 and 8 March 2021. When schools reopened from 8 March 2021, we assumed a reduction in the per-contact transmission probabilities by 37% in schools, i.e. simulated 63% of transmission within schools remaining from September.

In Covasim, testing is modelled using parameters that determine the probabilities with which people with different symptoms receive a test each day, for both symptomatic and asymptomatic people, based on the reported testing levels from [2].

Within the school layer, we simulated children of different ages as attending either primary or secondary schools, with attendance changing due to the three COVID-19-related lockdowns and school holidays.

Tracing is modelled using parameters for the probability of reaching the contacts of those testing positive, as well as the time taken to reach them.

This was modelled as an aggregated reduction in transmission due to hygiene, mask usage and other social distancing measures in place within schools to reduce transmission, and as described in detail in [17].

During the calibration process, the time series of severe cases were matched to the data on daily hospital admissions from the COVID-19 Dashboard by deriving an optimal value of a parameter that transferred from diagnoses to severe cases.

Generalized additive models (GAMs) have the general regression form: E(Y) = g−1( β0 + J ∑ j=1 fj(xj) ) , (2.1) where E(Y) is the expected value of the response (count) assuming an appropriate distribution with link function g(.), β0 is an intercept and fj is a smooth function (often a spline) of covariate(s) xj.

Districts that are closer together were assumed to be more similar than those further away, so spatial correlation was accounted for using the smooth effects.

The weekly count of variants in each local district was modelled using a negative-binomial distribution, which allows for potential overdispersion relative to the equal mean-variance relation assumed under a Poisson distribution.

Following [12], we commenced the analysis with the simplest model assuming equivalence between variants and worked up to the most complex model assuming complete segregation between variants.

That is, we estimated the difference in exponential growth rates between competing variants, which we transformed into a relative transmissibility value R, where T is the mean generation time which is assumed to be 5.5 days as in [6]. We note that this is an approximate transformation, assuming the generation time T distribution is a delta function concentrated at its mean.

The assumed effectiveness of vaccines against each variant is shown in figure 3 and discussed further in the next section.

When schools reopened from 8 March 2021, we assumed a reduction in the per-contact transmission probabilities by 37% in schools, i.e. simulated 63% of transmission within schools remaining from September.

We note that the symptomatic testing rates were assumed constant for the post-step 4 period.

We assume that some layers of society would be easier to trace than others; specifically, that 100% of household contacts can be traced within the same day, 80% of school and workplaces can be traced within 1 day and 10% of community contacts can successfully be traced within 2 days.

Projecting results of any model, including ours, too far into the future based on current data is unwise due to increasing uncertainty (including uncertainty about the continued validity of model assumptions.

Limitations
Our work has some limitations and aspects that require further study. Firstly, our statistical approach used the latitude and longitude of LTLAs to assume a smoothed Euclidian representation of distance across England.

Secondly, in this study and when using Covasim in general, though we have aimed to use the most recent data from the literature to parameterise the model, some questions remain unanswered.

Specifically, the version of Covasim used in this study assumed a single antibody waning function for all individuals and all types of immunities, with individual- and immune-level variation in the level of NAbs. As future results reveal differences in the antibody kinetics of infection- vs. vaccine-derived NAbs, this assumption will be revisited.

Furthermore, we note short-term epidemic dynamics are driven by assumptions regarding waning immunity and population heterogeneity, which together determine whether a given variant will die out or reach an endemic state.

Thirdly, we calibrated the model to aggregated English national data on reported cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

Finally, we chose the dates to compare different variants to reflect the period of exponential growth of the emerging variant as per figure 1, and we only considered LTLAs where the prevalence of the variant reached greater than 50%.",Yes,https://github.com/Jasminapg/PTRSA-Covasim-paper,Yes,Covasim,Three or more different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics","Health Sciences, Mathematics (general), Statistics","1 The Big Data Institute and the Pandemic Sciences Institute, Nuffeld Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK

In this analysis, the number of imported cases and transmissibility for each variant were determined during the calibration process from within the ranges derived in the statistical analysis.

The level of adherence to isolation has parameters that differ across different layers of the population (see data sources and calibration section below).

In Covasim, hospital admissions are modelled by the number of severe cases.

After a susceptible individual is infected, the individual is exposed and becomes infectious after an incubation period ti, which is assumed to be a gamma distribution random number G(t; a, b).

The infectious are confirmed with a rate h, and removed with a rate k, so that probabilities of being either confirmed or removed in a time interval [t, t þ Dt] is given by P2 ¼ 1 ! ehDt or P3 ¼ 1 ! ekDt , respectively. The hospitalized persons are removed (recovery or death) with a rate m, hence the probability of being removed in a time interval [t, t þ Dt] is P4 ¼ 1 ! emDt . When an infectious individual is confirmed, we need to trace the close contacts and move the traced contacts to the quarantine compartment. It is usually difficult to carry out 100% close contact tracing, hence we assumed a factor r ð ' 1Þ for the tracing efficiency. In this study, we only considered the first-level contacts. For the individuals during quarantine, there are given rates h1(day!1 ) or h2(day!1 ) for exposed and infectious individuals to be confirmed, respectively, otherwise the quarantine individuals return to their original compartments",Stay at home; Get tested;  Contact tracing,"In this paper, we developed a mathematical model of the COVID-19 epidemic with confirmed case-driven contact tracing quarantine, and applied the model to evaluate the effectiveness of the policy of contact tracing and quarantine.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions,"We assumed a small-world network to represent the contact relationships among individuals.

In simulations, we took the default infection rate b ¼ 0.8 and assumed the quarantine rate r ¼ 0.7 that starts when the occurrence of the first infectious, however, the policy of social contact restriction may be implemented at a different time point, which was represented by the decreasing of the infection rate b. Firstly, we assumed that social contact restriction begins at day 50, with different values b from 0.1 to 0.8 (no restriction), smaller b means more strict restriction.

However, individual-based model simulation gives rise to stochastic responses, so the same quarantine rate may yield diverse responses. For instance, when r ¼ 0, an epidemic outbreak may occur in most cases, however, there are rare cases that both the final size and the infectious peak are very low, which means that the epidemic outbreak would not happen (Fig. 5b and c). These results suggest that the proposed delay differential equation model (19) can describe the average epidemic dynamics, however, it is not enough to describe the diverse responses due to the stochastic effect.

These results indicate that for infection diseases with a large infection rate, the policy of contact tracing quarantine can reduce the total infection number, however, may not be enough to eliminate the infections in a short time. This result is consistent with simulation results based on the individual-based model (Xu et al., 2021)

In mathematical modeling, the epidemic dynamics in the real world are often stochastic, as seen in individual-based model simulations. However, the delay-differential equation model (19) is a deterministic model and hence fails to describe the randomness of epidemic control. Particularly, the quarantine functions (16)e(18) can only give a phenomeno-logical formulation of the mean number of quarantine individuals. In real-world situations, the exact quarantine number is often a random number and unpredictable. Hence, the quarantine number should be extended to a random number based on the phenomenological expressions in (16)-(18), which yield a random differential equation model for the epidemic dynamics."

It can be used to forecast the number of infectious cases spread, to identify spatial hot spots across the region, to estimate the number of infected patients arriving at hospitals, to evaluate various lock down scenarios and counterfactual, and to generate early warnings for rapid emergency response management.

FACS generalises the process of disease modelling and provides a template to model any infectious disease. Thus allowing non-programmers (e.g., epidemiologists and healthcare data scientists) to use the framework as a disease modelling suite.

FabCovid19 is a partially automated implementation of our COVID19 simulation, and provides an environment for researchers to construct and modify COVID-19 simulations, instantiate and execute multiple runs for different rules, parameters and assumptions.

Text:
Macro-level interventions are those that are applicable to all agents (e.g., maintaining social distance) or to all sites of a particular type (e.g., prohibiting mass gathering, here modelled as visits to recreation areas), see Appendix B for operationalizations. These interventions electively suppress the spread and leave large parts of the population susceptible. Thus, the risk of a next wave and hence the need for renewed interventions remain unchanged

Figure shows two extreme cases for physical measures being the combination of keeping distance, washing hands, etc. (yes: Ph, no: NoPh) and regional openness to travellers from outside the region (entry permitted: RegEn, prohibited: RegCl) for the case of a total lock-down (LD) when agents stay at (and possibly work from) home and freedom(SOM) when agents are going to the school, office, and mass gatherings. The results show that taking no measures (permitting interregional travellers and no physical measures) generally leads to high mortality/ high immunity rate outcomes, while taking strict measures (closing regional borders and physical measures: red diamonds) often leads to low mortality/ low immunity rate outcomes. However, since the fraction of agents still susceptible at the end of the simulation is minus the immunity rate minus the mortality rate, the chance of a second wave is substantial for many (strict) policy mixes.

Subsequently, the betweenness centrality is computed for these site nodes and an aggregate betweenness centrality for households is computed by simply summing the centrality value of site nodes linked by members. In the next step, the B households with the highest ABC value are locked.
",Stay at home; Get vaccinated,"In addition, there is a state Vaccinated (V) and for both the vaccinated and recovered state we assume that the agent is no longer susceptible, cannot be infected, nor infect other agents.

In addition, there is a state Vaccinated (V) and for both the vaccinated and recovered state we assume that the agent is no longer susceptible, cannot be infected, nor infect other agents

In part, we are therefore forced to make assumptions

From a visual inspection of the onset plot in Li et al. (￿￿￿￿) and Akaike’s Information Criterion used by Cowling et al. (￿￿￿￿) on SARS, we assume a Lognormal distribution.

Following advanced compartmental models, we have assumed the state progression rates reported in Table 1.

For the purpose of the simulation, we assume a reduction of ⇢ times the decease rate when receiving hospital treatment.

Table 1: Assumed infection state progression rates by age-group (based on Aksamentov et al. 2020) and fatality count based on demographic statistics (CBS StatLine Dataset 7461)

The process of infection derives from assumptions on susceptibility and infectiousness and -in a spatial model- on physical proximity required for passing on the virus (e.g., in droplets when coughing or talking, or after touching contaminated objects)

For the time being, we have assumed that infectiousness within and across age cohorts and for disease stage (exposed, infected, severe, critical) are a uniform 10%, except for a uniform 5% infectiousness for the pre-symptomatic exposed state (E‘) presuming that yet few pathogens are emitted.

The spatio-temporal behaviour is specified for each agent explicitly and is assumed to be related to age, employment, household composition, house location, supermarket preference, favourite recreation area, etc.

Furthermore, we assume that agents move around randomly within the boundaries of their current location (e.g., workplace, school, house) and only when agents are physically close, they infect one another

It is assumed that agents always come to the workplace and to school when not locked in. Given the substantial impact, we assume that mass gatherings are prohibited

Under the assumptions that vaccination causes indefinite immunity and that vaccinated people cannot ‘silently spread’ the virus, the ’locking’ of a household is equivalent to vaccinating the household members.

Thus, for calibration, one needs to pick sensible transition probabilities pX, pY, pD, which differ considerably for each age cohort

In this implementation, agendas and movement patterns are stylized rather than calibrated to empirical data, both because of a lack of detailed agenda data and the simplification of the metropolitan area.

Given the role of households as transmission channels and connecting workplaces with schools, etc., we calibrate the household types and age distributions to empirical data.

We used 2019 demographic statistics derived from the Dutch statistics agency (CBS, Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek) StatLine Dataset 7461 to validate the Case Fatality Rate by age group

",Yes,"Note that, here we do not claim to predict real-world outcomes, but study the effects of such metric-based intervention properties in a controlled laboratory setting. The simulated world is highly stylized and only partly calibrated to real-world data.

The data on the duration of and transition probabilities between infected, severe, critical, and deceased states for COVID-19 is at present still fraught with uncertainty and varies from country to country for various reasons. In part, we are therefore forced to make assumptions

These however, affect the simulation outcomes only quantitatively and do not affect the outcome of our qualitative policy comparisons based on relative quantities. Our parameter settings are derived from the following sources: Reports on the incubation period τ E + τ E‘ , i.e., the delay from infection to symptoms of illness, for COVID-19 provide a preliminary estimate of an average duration of 5-6 days (Li et al. 2020; World Health Organization 2020)

Generalized Reduced Gradient numerical fitting on the empirical distribution yielded parameter estimates µ =1.45 and =0.65 (which yields a mean of eµ+ 2 ⇡ 5.3)

While the progression rates between infected, severe, critical and deceased states were largely unknown at time of the first submission of this paper, the emerging fatality rates by age cohort should resemble the figures reported in the literature.

Given that the agenda determines the frequency, location, and duration of interaction, the quantitative impact of interventions (e.g., closing schools) may be over- or underestimated. In case the spatio-temporal interaction occurs more (less) in the simulation than in reality, the impact of intervention is overestimated (underestimated). In Section ￿.￿ and Appendix D, alternative agendasareusedtoestablishtherobustnessofourfindingthatmetric-basedinterventionpermitsrefined positioning on the immunity-mortality curve.

To ensure that our claims about this refined control does not rest too much on limiting agents’ agendas, we conducted a preliminary robustness analysis for a change in the agenda.

The robustness hinges on the duration and number of interactions in the simulation as prediction for the rate of infection (and thereby immunity, and mortality rates

In a limited robustness study, this smooth decline is persistent for variation in the agenda and spatial spread of sites visited

Although the model does provide suggestions for an alternative class of interventions based on micro-level interventions, the simplified agendas of agents and the limited numbers and types of sites may over- or underestimate the effectiveness of particular policy interventions.

Moreover, since the first version of this model, new empirical data was established, which would permit updating our parameter choices, e.g., transition rates between disease states, hospitalization and ICU rates, state durations, and that these may well depend on age rate. During modelling and running simulations, new findings have been published and some we have not been able to incorporate.

D: Robustness for variations in agents’ agendas

Given that the purpose of the agent-based model is to study the level of control obtained through social network metric-based interventions rather than accurate forecasts, we are primarily interested in qualitative, comparative results across simulation runs with the same parameter settings. We provide a limited robustness check for variation in the agents’ agendas as this affects also the social network structure.

1-day simulations that can be performed in parallel.

Outputs from this set of ABM simulations are used to generate a contact network represented by a probability matrix assumed to be a function of agent scheduling and facility layout, and NOT a function of whether agents are infected or not.

In the example to showcase the utility of this model, we assume that the probability of infection during a close contact with an infectious individual is 100%.

We assume a 40% probability of asymptomatic infections which falls well within the range of 30% to 45% as reported in the literature44–46. 

We note that recent data showing that reinfections are possible may invalidate this assumption. Currently infected individuals are also assumed to be non-susceptible. 

We assume that 1 week of operation is enough to compute the daily probability of any two agents making contact (or in other words, weekly schedules don’t vary much from week to week) and run five 1-day 
ABM simulations at each occupancy rate to compute the contact probability matrix.

We further assume that 40% of new infected individuals are asymptomatic46. 

Compared to larger scale infection studies (e.g., cities or countries) where all pairs of agents are assumed to have the same probability of close contact, two key differences from our simulation results are noticeable: (1) the timing of the peak is relatively constant across all occupancy levels and (2) the infection rate decays exponentially past the peak.

Other types of facilities with constantly changing occupants such as transit stations, restaurants, grocery stores, and event spaces (e.g., stadiums) were purposefully left outside of the scope of this work. To apply our method to those types of facilities, a distinction must be made between permanent (e.g., employees) and temporary occupants (e.g., customers). Additionally, the infection status of the latter will not be tracked over long-term horizons. Daily customer-to-customer transmissions can still be recorded but the primary focus for long-term analysis would be on customer-to-employee and employee-to-employee transmissions.

A good fit also requires an assumption that the epidemic started in January 2020, earlier than was previously assumed in Report 9.

Assumptions + Limitations (implied)

To predict policymaking, it is assumed that 
these interventions are implemented when demand for ICU beds reaches a particular “trigger” level. As the model contains far more realistic detail than the data available, the results are averages over many runs with different starting conditions, all of which are consistent with known data. The real epidemic is just one of these possibilities, so the code determines the range of scenarios for which plans should be made. This is particularly important when the numbers of localised outbreaks are low: the prediction that local spikes will occur somewhere is reliable, and the most likely places can be identified, but predicting exactly when and where is not possible with the level of data available. 

Further lockdowns would lead to 
a repeating series of waves of infection unless herd immunity is achieved by vaccination, which is not considered in the model.

Since this paper was first written (June 2020), UK policy has moved to more local interventions. CovidSim models the geography of all towns, but only the simulated people are representative of the true population. This uncertainty means that the model cannot reliably predict which town will experience an outbreak. Specifically, whereas the timing of the national outbreak is uncertain by days, the timing of an outbreak in a town is uncertain by months. IBMIC is the most precise model available, but substantially more personal data would be needed to obtain reliable local predictions.",Yes,https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3746,Yes,"We used GitHub tagged version 0.14.0 plus additional patches dated before 3 June 2020, the full technical details of which are published elsewhere.[8] Ferguson et al[9] supplied the input files relevant to Report 9 that were included in the GitHub release.

To reproduce the result tables for the scenarios presented in Report 9, we averaged over 10 simulation runs with the same random number seeds as used in the original report.

Despite the level of detail in the model, the data are insufficient to model real people: we observed that for a major national epidemic, insufficient data introduce an uncertainty of about five days in the predictions. At a local level, and with a lower reproduction number, this uncertainty in the timing of the epidemic is greatly increased: it is impossible to predict when a particular town will experience an outbreak (specifically, different towns experience outbreaks in different runs of the code).

This uncertainty means that the model cannot reliably predict which town will experience an outbreak. Specifically, whereas the timing of the national outbreak is uncertain by days, the timing of an outbreak in a town is uncertain by months."

List of intervention types explored in the simulation

Infected students were assumed to self-isolate from the next day after symptom onset

Students receive regular tests, and those who tested positive were assumed to self-isolate from the day of receiving the positive test; regular testing is always combined with symptom screening in our simulation

The interactions between students from different classes were reduced; a possible increase in within-class interactions resulting from limiting outside-class interactions was also considered as part of the scenarios

From the next day after symptom onset or the day of a positive test (when regular testing is in operation), all classmates of an infected student are held in quarantine for 10 d (COVID-19)/5 d (influenza)",No,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Julia,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
We then rescaled the estimates to the assumed within-school reproduction numbers and combined them with the temporal infection profile of SARS-CoV-2.

In the later simulation, we chose 50% as the baseline assumption for the proportion attributed to symptomatic students.

In addition to symptom screening, we also considered screening by regular (rapid) testing, which we assumed to detect infectious individuals at a given probability (sensitivity) from the second day of infectiousness.

We parameterized our simulation model using the estimates of within-school transmission patterns (i.e., the relative transmission risks between students within class, grade, and school) (Fig. 1D) of seasonal influenza in primary schools in Matsumoto City, Japan (43), assuming that both COVID-19 and influenza share a similar mode of transmission and spread over social contacts at school (50).

We assumed three values (2.0, 1.5, 0.8) for the within-school reproduction number RS as representative of the Delta-like, Alpha-like, and the original SARSCoV-2–/flu-like transmission potential, respectively, based on the estimate of RS = 0.8 for seasonal influenza (43) (Materials and Methods has more details).

To simulate outbreaks with “class cohorting,” where between-class interactions are reduced (e.g., by enforcing social bubbles within classes), we employed two different assumptions on the change in within-class interactions.

The latter assumption of compensatory increase may be in line with our previous study (43), which suggested that the total number of within-grade transmission per primary case was nearly constant regardless of the number of classes.

The risk of large outbreaks decreases if we assume a high degree of overdispersion in the individual-level transmission as is observed with general outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 (51) (i.e., an overdispersion parameter of 0.2); however, assuming the same threshold for an acceptable risk (i.e., ∼20% risk of up to 10 secondary transmissions given 10 introductions), RS of 0.5 or below should remain the primary target of routine school interventions (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).

If the proportion of transmission attributable to symptomatic infections is lower than our baseline assumption of 50%, the outbreak could reach a substantial size (even over 10 or 20 infections) by the time the first case shows symptoms.

We assumed that students are regularly tested without a specific preference on the day of the week and that the number of students who undertake a test is thus uniformly distributed over a week.

For simplicity, we assumed that transmission risks between students are determined by class/grade structures and neglected the effect of other variables, such as sex, age, and individual-level precaution measures (therefore, grades in the simulations were only for labeling purpose and did not necessarily correspond to actual school years).

For the baseline simulation, we assumed six year groups per school, with two classes (40 students each) per grade (i.e., n = 40, m = 2).

Here, we limited our simulation to the within-school transmission dynamics, and students not attending school (e.g., on weekends or in isolation/quarantine) were assumed not to be involved in transmission.

RS was estimated to be around 0.8 for seasonal influenza (43), and we assumed the same value for the original SARS-CoV-2 strain because the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 is 1.5 to 2 times higher than seasonal influenza (64), while children were estimated to be about half as susceptible to infection (9).

However, these assumed values in our simulation should be viewed as hypothetical scenarios rather than accurate estimates. For each of the assumed values of RS, we rescaled the posterior samples of the relationship-specific transmissibility parameter βd such that the relative magnitude between βd is conserved and that their sum corresponds to the value of RS.

We assumed that within-class interactions may increase by 20% to compensate for a 50% reduction outside of class and by 40% to compensate for a 90% reduction.

The class closure was assumed to last for 10 d (COVID-19) or 5 d (pandemic influenza). 

Note that symptom screening is also assumed to be conducted in the “10% regular tests” scenario.

Infected students were assumed to self-isolate from the next day after symptom onset

Students receive regular tests, and those who tested positive were assumed to self-isolate from the day of receiving the positive test; regular testing is always combined with symptom screening in our simulation

Limitations, caveat
This calibration allowed us to capture granular social contact patterns relevant to empirical transmission dynamics of respiratory virus in schools, including the correlations between transmission patterns and class/school sizes, although with a caveat of the dataset being observational.

Several limitations must be noted for our analysis. First, there were potential sources of bias inherent to the nature of the Matsumoto City dataset, which we used for model calibration.

We assumed that if class structures were altered by interventions, students would rewire their contacts according to the new class structure.

Second, the epidemiological properties used in our simulation were subject to a number of assumptions. Within- and between-class/grade transmission patterns of COVID-19 and pandemic influenza were assumed to be proportional to those of seasonal influenza and scaled by the chosen RS in the simulation.

Temporal profiles of infectiousness and the proportion of symptomatic infections were based on limited data (mostly from studies before the emergence of variants) and also, neglected individual-level variation.

Third, several potentially important elements in transmission dynamics have not been fully considered in our simulation. Students were assumed to only contact each other at school, and possible contacts outside of school on weekends or during closure/isolation were neglected as we assume that such contacts would not be encouraged during an outbreak.

Individual-level precautionary measures that are not expected to change the dynamical patterns of transmission (i.e., whose effect may be incorporated only by changing the assumed value of RS), including vaccines, universal masking, ventilation, etc., were not explicitly modeled and were assumed to be reflected by the value of RS in the simulation.",Yes,https://github.com/akira-endo/schooldynamics_FluMatsumoto14-15,Yes,"To overcome these limitations and provide a more robust assessment of school-based interventions, we parameterized a within-school transmission model that considers social contacts within and between classes and grades to a detailed dataset of seasonal influenza from 29 primary schools with a total of over 10,000 students (43).",Two different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Industry",Health Sciences,"1.

While this study demonstrates the need of using empirical activity patterns to obtain higher accuracy in modeling epidemics, the study also has limitations that need to be recognized.

These may be significantly different activity patterns than those expected during a pandemic, and better models based on data of human activity collected during an epidemic (e.g., COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports [50]) are necessary for developing more accurate predicted models.

In terms of current or future DfE action criteria (e.g. [31,37]), our model could be tailored straightforwardly to schools’ demographics and to the relevant local community incidence level.

Thus, our purpose here is to illustrate the effectiveness of coupling our classroom-level infection model with national-scale epidemiological models and, notwithstanding limitations just noted, to show that its application provides policy-relevant information for decision-makers.

Our basic model is for in-classroom transmission, but individual schools can be modelled as collections of such classes such that the results can be applied to local authority areas and academy networks and provide estimates on a national scale.

Our transmission modelling results, reported above, provide one objective basis for informing appraisals of the relative efficacies of different mitigation measures in classroom conditions in primary schools (and other education gatherings).

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with different transmissibility properties suggests that there could be distinct differences in the efficacies of bubbles and testing when it to comes to projected infection levels in schools, and hence potential absence rates; our model parameterization is easily adjusted for quantifying such effects and can, we believe, offer punctual and auditable information on incipient infection fluctuations for policy purposes.",Yes, United Kingdom,Considered and self initiated,"The agent could be considered to have reactionary behavior; for example, when an agent becomes visibly sick/symptomatic, they immediately quarantine, and the same is true for when teachers quarantine, the reaction being an immediate substitute teacher.

we consider several ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ approaches. Soft measures include enhanced cleaning and hygiene, as well as the reduction of mixing of separate classrooms (e.g. through staggered entry, breaks and lunch times; multiple and separated entry points to the school, etc.).

To include vaccination in our model, on initialization of the class members, we perform Bernoulli trials using estimates of the vaccination uptake proportion.",Yes,"Statistical representation of close contacts between children and adults within school settings is derived from a study of 36 primary schools in England using teachers’ expert judgements, formally elicited in spring/summer 2020 [2]; in that study, close contact was defined to be a face-to-face contact within 1 m for at least 5 min.

In our model, eCDFs for the number of contacts in classrooms are those derived from pooled expert responses in an elicitation for primary school pupils and classroom staff [2]. That study determined different contact rates in: (i) the pre-COVID classroom, and then (ii) following implementation of bubbles and other measures to reduce the number of contacts [2].",No,,Yes,‘bubble quarantine’ where an unwell individual results in quarantine of the whole class,No,,No,,No,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"A number of assumptions underpin our model, with some contingent limitations. It considers only close contacts (n.b. defined here as per [2]) as the predominant infection transmission pathway among persons in a classroom. Unavoidably, the contact pattern data we have used, derived from teacher elicitations [2], are an approximation of complex varying patterns of human interactions. Our model also assumes each classroom is isolated and independent of other classrooms, as far as transmission likelihood is concerned.

Our model also simplifies the complex social interactions by assuming that contacts are randomly distributed among all members of a class, whereas there will be friendship groups resulting in variations in the connectness of the individuals with one another. The in-classroom transmission of infection in our model is assumed to be predominantly through close contacts.

In relation to infection transmissions, the modelled classroom population is assumed to be isolated from other classes and persons within the school, so the present model does not include interactions with other people in the school. This is a major assumption and is best suited to primary school settings where classroom groups can be most effectively separated from one another as a part of infection risk management; this was a mitigation instituted in March 2020 for primary schools in England that were open for vulnerable children and those of critical workers and, later, as other schools in England reopened to selected age groups in June 2020. The simplifying assumption is also justified by evidence for limited mixing across different classes and year groups in UK primary schools [3].

At this stage, we assume that symptoms of infection would be recognized by the infected individual or observed by others and, if such symptoms are detected or confirmed, usually by testing, then a U individual will be Q.

The R state collects infected individuals following their period of being U, or for the duration of the infectious period for asymptomatic cases, at which stage they are assumed to have acquired immunity from further SARSCoV-2 infection for the simulation period.

Note that this approach combines the infectiousness of the index case with the susceptibility of their contact into a single probability of transmission. This is a simplifying assumption in the model, but includes individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for the population in the model.

We have also alluded to the simplification of treating schools as a collection of isolated classrooms and that transmission outside the classroom is assumed to be minor in agreement with mixing studies [3].

Thus, our purpose here is to illustrate the effectiveness of coupling our classroom-level infection model with national-scale epidemiological models and, notwithstanding limitations just noted, to show that its application provides policy-relevant information for decision-makers.

Here, the model assumptions and parameters have been changed from the September 2020 situation to include a largely vaccinated adult population and the more virulent Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. We have contrasted two different contact patterns, namely pre-COVID with no mitigation and then reduced contact levels, as ascribed to primary schools in term 1 of 2020.

We assumed that severe symptomatic cases who were not hospitalized self-isolated immediately upon symptom onset and they limited their daily contacts to a maximum of three until recovery.

We considered non-medical cloth masks (referred to as masks in the following) as an intervention measure for the general population, with compliance rates of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% for individuals aged 2 and older based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (CDC, 2020).

We also implemented shelter-in-place strategies based on age and comorbidities by considering eight scenarios, as described in Table 2.
",Stay at home; Wear a mask; Get tested;  contact tracing,"Therefore, we conducted

1% of the population when a highly efficient strategy of sheltering
individuals aged 50–64 years (S3) was combined with mask-
wearing by those not sheltered-in-place. Our results showed that if
testing capacity and contact tracing allowed for 33% of silent
infections to be identified, outbreak control could be achieved by
implementing S3 with 75% mask-wearing

We considered non-medical cloth masks (referred to as masks in the following) as an intervention measure for the general population, with compliance rates of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% for individuals aged 2 and older based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (CDC, 2020). This range of compliance is based on recent polling results, which suggest that the rate of compliance remains below 75% despite mandatory mask-wearing in some states (CNN, 2020b).

We also implemented shelter-in-place strategies based on age and
comorbidities by considering eight scenarios, as described in Table 2. Under any of these scenarios, the daily interactions of individuals who were sheltered-in-place were parameterized from an age-dependent contact matrix (Appendix: Table S2).

",No,,Calibration,"We also estimated the reduction in secondary infections that could be achieved by mask-wearing. Compared to the no-intervention scenario (corresponding to model calibration with R0 = 2.5), mask-wearing compliance rates of 25%, 50%, and 75% reduced the reproduction number to 2.30, 2.04, and 1.79, respectively.",Yes,"We found that non-medical mask-wearing by 75% of the population reduced infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 37.7% (interquartile range (IQR): 36.1–39.4%), 44.2% (IQR: 42.9–45.8%), and 47.2% (IQR: 45.5–48.7%), respectively, in the absence of a shelter-in-place strategy.

Table 1 Model parameters, values, and distributions.

For a mask-wearing compliance rate of 25%, we projected a median reduction of 9.6% (interquartile range (IQR): 7.3–11.7%) for the attack rate, 11.9% (IQR: 9.8–14.3%) for hospitalizations, and 14.0% (IQR: 11.9–16.1%) for deaths compared to no mask-wearing (Figure 1B). When we increased the mask-wearing compliance rate to 75%, the median reductions in the attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths were substantially higher at 37.7% (IQR: 36.1–39.4%), 44.2% (IQR: 42.9–45.8%), and 47.2% (IQR: 45.5 48.7%), respectively (Figure 1B).

When shelter-in-place was implemented, the timing of peak incidence was delayed and its magnitude was reduced for each scenario (Figure 2). Assuming population immunity of 5% and in the absence of mask-wearing, the lowest effect on reducing the attack rate (median: 13.9%; IQR: 11.6–16.2%) was associated with sheltering individuals aged 65 years and older (S4). S4 also led to the highest and earliest peak of incidence (Figure 2A). Sheltering children aged 5–19 years (S1) was slightly more effective in reducing the attack rate (median: 19.7%; IQR: 17.5–21.4%) as well as delaying and lowering the peak incidence.

Figure 3. Reductions achieved in attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths with each shelter-in-place strategy combined with mask-wearing compliance rates of 0% (A1, B1, C1), 25% (A2, B2, C2), 50% (A3, B3, C3), and 75% (A4, B4, C4). The level of pre-existing immunity in the population was assumed to be 5% for all scenarios

With 75% mask-wearing, the median reduction in the attack rate under S3 was projected as 82.5% (IQR: 81.6–83.5%) and the median reductions in hospitalizations and deaths exceeded 86% and 87%, respectively.

In the absence of mask-wearing, S3 resulted in the highest numbers of averted infections (median: 1.69; IQR: 1.65 1.75), hospitalizations (median: 0.085; IQR: 0.083–0.087), and deaths (median: 0.0091; IQR: 0.0088–0.0093) per person sheltered-in-place, as shown in Figure 4.

Strategy S1 (children aged 5 to 19) required sheltering-in place for the same proportion of the population as strategy S3, but S1 was the least ef client strategy in terms of averting hospitalizations (0.021, IQR: 0.019–0.024) and deaths (0.0024, IQR: 0.0022–0.0027) per person sheltered-in-place, mainly due to a high proportion of daily contacts occurring within their own age group (5–19 years), as well as better clinical outcomes when children are infected with COVID-19 compared to older age groups (Shekerdemian et al., 2020).

Community social distancing. This intervention encourages members of the general public to reduce voluntary contacts outside of the home (not counting workplaces). The model assumes that community contacts are reduced by 25% under this intervention.

Self-isolation for symptoms. Under this intervention, members of the general public are encouraged to stay home of they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. The model assumes that symptomatic people self-isolate 33% of the time (i.e. an average of 2.3 days per ill individual).

The number of schools is selected assuming that children at school make effective contact (i.e. contact sufficient to transmit SARS-CoV2 from an infectious to a susceptible agent) with up to 100 other children at school. Workplace sizes are distributed according to the business sizes from the 2018 Small Business Profile for Washington State [7], with the assumption that workers in businesses of more than 100 persons only make effective contact with up to 100 workers per day.

Schools in the model were closed as of March 12th, after which children and teachers were assumed to stay home during the workday.

The probability of infection for each Infectious contact is assumed to be higher within households than in the community [10,11].

The latent period is between 3 and 5 days [12,13], and the incubation period is assumed to be 1-3 days longer than the latent period, so that individuals become infectious before becoming symptomatic [14-16].

Agents are assumed to be equally infectious regardless of age or time since infection.

At the end of the infectious period, agents become Recovered and are assumed to be immune to infection for the duration of the simulation; that is, that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces functional immunity that lasts up to 12 months.

For modeling purposes, this intervention assumes that 33% of workers are able to telecommute, which is based on the reduction in travel to workplaces observed in early March, when large employers were encouraging work-from-home but before mandates against large gatherings were established [9].

In the model, this strategy assumes that nursing homes are closed persons with COVID-19 symptoms (including both visitors and staff), and that seniors in the community reduce their community contacts by 90%.

To determine the potential impact of these interventions individually, each intervention was applied as of March 12th 2020 (the date schools were closed) assuming that no other interventions occurred.

To this end, the number of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients over time is predicted using each of the strategies tested, assuming that the interventions start on June 22nd 2020. These analyses assume that the interventions replace other current or potential measures such as bans on large gatherings.

Limitations (based on model assumptions)
This agent-based model makes several key assumptions which may impact its accuracy. First, for computational simplicity, the model does not include demographic processes e births, deaths, or aging. Over short model runs (1 year) this assumption is unlikely to meaningfully impact model forecasts, but the lack of births (which introduce new Susceptible individuals) would become unrealistic over longer runs. Second, the model assumes that all Infectious individuals are equally infectious.

Third, the model assumes that Infectious agents are equally infectious during their entire infectious period. Fourth, while the probability of severe disease among infectious agents varies by age, the probability of infection given contact with an infectious agent is assumed to be identical for all susceptible agents. Fifth, the model assumes that SARS-CoV-2 transmission does not vary meaningfully by season.

We consider two vaccination scenarios: In vaccination scenario I, 80% of teachers, 60% of family members reflecting the vaccination prevalence in the general population and 0% of students are vaccinated (in line with observations of vaccine uptake in Austrian teachers) (see https://orf.at/stories/ 3227808/, accessed on September 12, 2021) and the general population (see https://info.gesundheitsministerium.at/, accessed on September 12, 2021) as of September 2021.

Using the model, we study the effectiveness of four categories of NPIs and their combinations as well as different shares of vaccinated students or teachers. The NPIs include (i) room ventilation, (ii) use of surgical masks of teachers and students during lessons (it is assumed that masks are always worn in schools when students are not sitting at their desk), (iii) student cohorting, and (iv) screenings by use of entry AG tests for SARSCoV-2 at different frequencies. As a reference scenario we consider a test-trace-isolate strategy in which students and teachers are PCR-tested as soon as they develop symptoms.

Regarding the efficiency of screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic students and teachers by AG testing, we vary the sensitivity between 10% and 100%, the proportion of teachers and students participating voluntarily in testing between 10% and 100% of the agent population and the proportion of students staying at home when class sizes are reduced between 20% and 80% in each class.

This assumption results in a bimodal distribution of the cluster size containing small clusters of ten or less cases and large cluster with up to hundred cases or more in secondary schools.

Assuming average school sizes of 152, 144, 230 and 674 students for primary, lower secondary, upper secondary and secondary schools33 and no vaccinations, on average we find 69 cases per cluster in primary schools (75th percentile: 127 cases, 90th percentile: 206), 211 (303, 3014) cases in lower secondary schools and 1073 (1402, 1420) cases per cluster in secondary schools, overall.

In summary, with these very conservative assumptions for measure effectiveness, no combination of measures is able to achieve R < 1, even in primary schools. This means that control of the delta variant in schools cannot be achieved by these NPIs under conservative assumptions in an unvaccinated scenario.

The agent-based model makes several coarse-graining assumptions.

These interactions are assumed to be less frequent and less relevant than the interactions represented in the model.

Fifth and finally, regarding the effectiveness of vaccinations, we assume a constant effectiveness that is the same for every agent, and a static ratio of vaccinated agents.

Our work is subject to several limitations, pertaining both to the observational cluster data our calibration relies on, as well as to simplifications employed in the model.

in this situation: a) in which direction will the SARS-CoV2 virus causing COVID-19 evolve?, and b) which aggregate dynamics can we expect from an evolving virus in terms of infections and fatalities? In order to study these topics, i develop a parsimonious epidemiological model that simultaneously captures two types of viral evolution:
a) Genetic variation: Mutations can change the characteristics of a virus in a way that alter its evolutionary fitness, e.g., by increasing its transmissibility (Chen et al.
2020).
b) Antigenic variation (Yuan et al. 2021): Antigenic drift is a process in which the virus changes its antigenic profile.

2.2 Uniform social distancing

Uniform social distancing (which could also be imagined as a blanket lockdown or compulsory mask-wearing) reduces the number of social contacts (or their infectiousness) for all individuals in the same way.1

2.3 Isolation of symptomatic cases",No,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,NetLogo,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions

Like the standard SIR model, this model operates on the simplifying homogenous mixing assumption, i.e., every member of compartment i has an equal probability to meet a member of compartment j.

In order to capture mutations, the interplay between the variants, while at the same
time keeping the analysis as simple as possible, I make the following assumptions:
1. Each agent may only be infected by one virus variant simultaneously.
2. Whenever an individual is infected, the virus may mutate, creating a new variant which is an offspring of the infecting (“parent”) variant.
3. A mutation randomly changes the properties of the virus (infectiousness, latent period, share of asymptomatic infections, incubation period, disease duration, lethality) with the means given by the actual values of the parent variant (see Eq. 19).
4. Each virus variant belongs has an antigenic cluster that may change during a mutation, i.e., a mutation may be coupled with an antigenic drift.[footnote 4]
5. A previous infection within the same antigenic cluster provides perfect cross-
immunity between variants. It may provide cross-immunity between antigenic
clusters depending on the antigenic (evolutionary) distance between two antigenic clusters.
6. Each agent has an equal probability to meet another agent (i.e., homogeneous
mixing).

Limitations

My model is limited in various ways: First, it assumes that each property of the virus and associated disease may be subject to the same process of stochastic change, which is an obvious stylization. Second, it assumes a lethality rate, and, more generally, all properties of the disease which are uniform across the population. Relaxing this assumption in order to account for e.g., an age-dependent severity of the disease,
may influence the results by reducing mortality even in case of lower levels of cross-protection gained from a past infection (or vaccination). Third, my model does not consider behavioral heterogeneity within the population (Mellacher 2021b) or endogenous changes in the social distancing behavior of the population (Lux 2021; Proaño and Makarewicz 2021). Fourth, my model purely concentrates on public health outcomes and thus does not consider any societal or economic impact of social distancing.",Yes,https://github.com/patrickmellacher/viralmutations,No,,One discipline,Social Sciences,Economics,"Graz Schumpeter Centre, University of Graz, Graz, Austria",No,,Calibration,This calibration allows for a basic reproduction number of the SARS-CoV2 wild type of 2.5 and a share of pre-symptomatic infections of 50% as estimated by the CDC (2021).,Yes,"Monte Carlo simulations show that a) containment policy design has an impact on both speed and direction of viral evolution, b) the virus may circulate in the population indefinitely, provided that containment efforts are too relaxed and the propensity of the virus to escape immunity is high enough, and crucially c) that it may not be possible to distinguish between a slowly and a rapidly evolving virus by looking only at short-term epidemiological outcomes.

The mean (θ) is set to 0 in order not to presuppose any direction of evolution.

Following empirical research on the influenza virus (Smith et al. 2004), this is modeled by assuming that each variant belongs to an “antigenic cluster.”

During each simulation step, a counter (which is initialized with 0 for newly infected individuals) records the time passed since becoming infected.

However, we conducted a series of robustness checks for the most important of those parameters (cf. S1–S5 Figs). Sensitivity analyses suggest that the results are robust to changes in the parameters and, hence, to potential errors in assumed values.",Yes,"Like every survey, SOEP has to deal with missing values. For 3.53% of the sample we replace missing data on working hours by age- and gender-specific group means. For 3.46% of the sample, we replace missing data on the occupation with a random occupation code in each simulation run. For cases with missing information about the time spent daily in supermarkets (26,92%) we impute the overall mean (approximately 1h). Finally, 1.62% of the households are excluded, because the case itself or a member of the corresponding household has missing data.

This infection probability per time step is an important, yet unknown parameter and is therefore determined by model calibration to empirical infection data of a given state (cf. section Calibration). In the model calibrated for this study, these infection probabilities range from 0.04727 to 0.0645 (cf. Table 3)

The period of time from the onset of symptoms of one of the household member to the isolation of the whole household is one of the two calibrated parameters and lies between 21 and 26 time steps (cf. Table 3)

Due to the many stochastic elements used in the simulation, each single run of the model returns different results, even when the same set of parameters is used. Thus, to obtain reliable results for a given set of parameters we run 60 repetitions of model runs and average the results.

For each model to be calibrated, we searched for the set of model parameters that generate simulated data with the smallest deviation from the corresponding daily empirical data on a cumulative number of infections (data source: [40]). We stopped the calibration process when at least one set of parameters was found to generate simulated data with a fit of a root mean squared error less than 20.

We acknowledge over-simplifications and assumptions in our model, many of which are common to ABMs. As a simplification, this system is an entirely closed system, with no births or deaths. In addition, we do not model geospatial networks.
ABMs use discrete time periods for modelling agent interactions, during which agents are usually devoted to one activity, so only one type of interaction can occur (attending school or work, being home or using public transport). While other systems use only two 12 hour time periods [1], DESSABNeT uses three time periods (approximately 8 hours each). Despite the detailed weekly agent schedules and entry into different containers creating a complex network of agent interactions, we acknowledge that persons within a container will mix homogenously.

Text: 
Here, we define a group as a set of people who engage in the same activity (e.g., shopping) in a single sector at one specific location, which creates the potential for physical contact and chance of transmissions. Members of a subgroup engage in the same economic activities, and each sub group

In the second strategy (“balancing groups”), some number of individuals approaching a destination are redirected to a different location with the same functionality to equalize the number of people at each location (Fig. 1D).

In the first strategy, each group is divided into two subgroups (e.g., a group of customers can only go to the grocery store in the morning, while another separate group of customers can only go in the afternoon). In the second strategy, we balance the number of group members across different groups within the same sector (e.g., every grocery store has the same number of customers)

The second scenario was a 3/6 activity restriction, in which ties for three activities (educational institutions, restaurants/cafés, and sports/ leisure) were removed out of a set of six activities (family ties or ties in medical institutions were not removed) (“intermediate lockdown”). This level of lockdown might be less strict than one shown in a previous paper (28) and the level of actual lockdown in the states of New York (47) and California (48). The third scenario was a 6/6 activity restriction, in which ties for all six activities (the three activities above plus those in workplaces, grocery stores, and other groups) were removed (“strict lockdown”). The replicating lockdown strategies involve a commensurate sacrifice of economic activities. The final three scenarios demonstrate the “dividing groups” strategy, the “balancing groups” strategy, and the strategy combining the two strategies, in which group sizes of all post division subgroups in each sector are balanced (D + B) (Fig. 1E).

In combination with other measures such as self-isolation and physical distancing, the institution of our strategies would result in Reff below 1.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume) 
In the simulations, we assume that people engage in group activities in multiple sectors (e.g., going to work, going to a local grocery store), where they interact with others in the same group and potentially become infected.

We assumed that, once a virus is transmitted, exposed individuals experience a latent period of 3 d and become infectious for an average of 3 d (an infectious period for each individual is randomly drawn from a geometric distribution) (39).

We assume that the acquired immunity persists until the end of the simulation (300 d) (see Materials and Methods).

We assumed density-dependent mixing during the simulation (43): Group members had a constant possibility of interacting with one another and of transmitting the virus of 4.458% (β = 0.04458) per day per network tie with a weight of 1 (family tie).

Individuals may share groups in multiple sectors (e.g., two people work at the same place and shop at the same grocery store); in such cases, the possibility of transmission was assumed to multiply.

Our simulations also assumed that, once the network interventions are implemented, agents will repeat their actions (aside from the simulation where symptomatic individuals were required to self-isolate) and thus will not contribute to further mixing of populations (e.g., members of a group who are diverted to store Y away from store X will continue to go to store Y and not attempt to return to store X).

Most importantly, we assumed that our simulations primarily followed a density-dependent mixing model (43), where increases in group size correspond to proportional increases in the number of contacts, potentially causing a viral transmission. In other words, in addition to a small number of close contacts (close school friends), a classroom of 20 college students is twice as likely as a classroom of 10 college students to experience a transmission event; however, this assumption may be reasonable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, given a number of recent cluster events originating from large social gatherings (54).

For the workplace sector, we assumed that 20% of registered businesses were dormant and another 20% were owned by a parent company or shared an owner with another registered business (and therefore should not count as an additional business for the simulation).

We assumed that all members of a single family comprised a complete network, where all possible network ties were drawn to other family members within the family.

Next, we constructed weak ties by assuming that individuals belong to social groups in which they have a chance to physically interact with others.

We assumed that individuals could not belong to more than one group from the same sector; therefore, the maximum number of groups an individual could belong to is seven (one group from each of the sectors).

For the education sector, we assumed that everybody between the ages of 0 y and 19 y goes to school and everybody outside of that age range does not and used 25% as the enrollment rate of the education sector.

We assumed a certain number of open hours each week for the different sectors (40 h for workplace, education, healthcare, grocery, and restaurant/café [weekdays and weekends], and 16 h for sports/ leisure and other [mainly weekends only]) and the hours per week when people engage (30 h for workplace and education, 1 h for healthcare, 2 h for grocery, and 4 h for restaurant/café, sports/leisure, and other).

For close ties [physical contact or two-way conversation without physical distancing (40)], we assumed that these ties arise only in some of the sectors (workplaces, educational institutions, sports/leisure groups, and other groups). Based on the fraction of close ties previously reported (40, 42), we assumed that a typical individual has up to eight close ties in sports/leisure sectors, six close ties in workplaces, and four close ties in the educational institutions other sectors.

Consequently, using density-dependent mixing (43), we assumed that all group members in each group in each sector had a constant possibility of interacting with each other (which are counted as network ties), regardless of overall group size.

We used an asymptomatic ratio of 45% (77), and assumed that the pre-symptomatic period and the post-symptomatic period both extend to half of the duration of the infectious period (78).

We also assumed that transmissibility of asymptomatic cases was the same as that of symptomatic cases (β of 0.04458 was used) (62, 63).

Limitations
Like other simulation studies, a key limitation to this analysis is that we only explored agent-based simulations with specific parameter spaces and with specific assumptions. In reality, there are hundreds or thousands of “sectors” of daily life, the number of sectors that each individual belongs to varies, the transmission probability would change based on the symptoms and other factors of the host, and the possibility of virus subtypes would affect the rate of infection among other factors (49, 50).

Although we believe that we used realistic network structures in our simulations, the predicted effects of the proposed strategies should be interpreted with caution, due to the simplistic and demography-specific nature of our model. Particularly, our model needs to be tailored and calibrated with relevant parameters and data to reliably assess the potential impacts of these strategies in specific settings and contexts.",Yes,https://github.com/akihironishi/covid19_pnas,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Industry","Computer science, Health Sciences, Sociology, Demography, and Population Studies, Psychiatry","Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095

To explore different scenarios of local and global epidemic sizes, we accounted for different pandemic stages and uncertainty in epidemiological parameters by systematically varying the following six parameters (see electronic supplementary material, table S1):

We then combined each baseline transmission scenario with varying parameters for each of the three control strategies, running a total of 40 000 simulations, each for a time period of 100 days, which we assumed to be sufficiently long to capture the epidemic dynamics in response to different parameter values.

Limitations

Our study is affected by limitations. First, we analyzed the effect of digital contact tracing on COVID-19 incidence in the general population. Crucial information for public health authorities would be to quantify the effect in time of these measures on hospitalizations. This would require to couple 
our model for COVID-19 transmission in the general population with a model describing disease severity and within-hospital patient trajectories (17, 21, 26). Second, the model does not account for transmission in nursing homes. This setting is where the majority of transmissions among elderly occurred. At the same time, however, the response to the COVID-19 epidemic in this setting relies mostly on routine screening of symptoms and frequent testing of residents, together with face masks and strict hygiene rules for visitors. Third, results may be conservative as clustering effects and large fluctuations in the number of contacts per person (56) are only partially captured by the model thanks to the repetition of contacts, but effects may be larger in real contact patterns. This also includes crowding events playing an important role in the transmission dynamics (15). Overall behaviors obtained with our synthetic network of contacts are however compatible with findings obtained with real contact data (18). In a future work the description of temporal and topological properties of contacts in workplaces, schools and community could be improved by using modeling frameworks informed by detailed contact data, that has become available for specific settings (57–59). For this purpose, frameworks such as hidden variable models or other recent dynamical models for social networks could be employed (60–62). Fourth, other assumptions may be instead optimistic, regarding the probability of detection of index cases, and compliance to isolation, for example. Few data are available to inform these parameters that may also vary over time (depending on the epidemic context and increased population fatigue) and across countries (depending on cultural aspects and regulations in place). While we explored a range of parameter values, more detailed information will be needed to contextualize our approach to a specific epidemic situation in a given country.",No,,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Life Sciences, Industry","Computer science, Health Sciences","INSERM, Sorbonne Université, Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, Paris, France

B. Calibration, Sensitivity, and Validation of the Constructed Artificial Society We first calibrate the input parameters to obtain key characteristics in line with epidemiological data on COVID-19.

The models used in the artificial society are calibrated to the main features of COVID-19.

The artificial society of Wenzhou was calibrated to known pandemic dynamics and considered social context-dependent activities, social and household relationships, and other relevant epidemiological parameters. The robustness of our model was also verified through sensitivity analysis.

Moreover, we acknowledge that the models and evaluations of this work were only verified on historical datasets.

We also verify this point in other cities.

The sensitivity analysis also reveals that key epidemiological outputs of our model (e.g., the basic reproductive number and the generation period) are robust to uncertainty that existed in the input parameters.

Then, we apply a global sensitivity analysis [37] to testify to the robustness of our constructed models and their outcomes.

Smaller values of μi∗ and σi indicate the lower sensitivity of the output parameters.

The daily growth rate of cumulative incidence  ̇C shows small global sensitivity to all input parameters.

The increase in cumulative incidences would be more pronounced as the lockdowns are delayed, indicating that the number of cumulative incidences is sensitive to the lockdown measures at the early stage.

Specifically, the sensitivity of the (cumulative) incidence to population sizes of a city w.r.t. the initial number of infected cases (reflecting the initial transmission threat), the starting time of lockdowns, and the duration time of lockdowns are tested, as shown in Fig. 8 (the size of a circle denotes the average confirmed infected cases in the simulation).

Furthermore, COVAM uses adherence to social distancing as a proxy for several factors contributing to disease transmission, including fewer close contacts because of limited travel and precautions that prevent transmission during close contact, such as wearing masks. Therefore, COVAM may not accurately estimate the effect of personal precau tions on transmission. There are also limitations related to the modeling approach. Our calibration procedure used a simple trial–and–error approach, as opposed to a full-scale calibration in which all plausible combinations of the input parameter values are tested (51). Owing to the computational intensity of a more formal and detailed calibration procedure, our calibration may not have identified the best parameter combinations. As with any other modeling technique, agent-based modeling has limitations, including greater computational needs compared with more commonly used compartmental models because of modeling of probabilistic events, as well as more complex development given that agent-based models typically require stylistic programming to represent events more realistically.

This parameter depends on population density and age group and is estimated using the literature and calibration

The theoretical basic reproductive number (R0) corresponding to these parameter estimates was 3.34 for Dane County without any social distancing measures, which was within the range of R0 values reported in the literature (1.5 to 6.5) (26, 27)

For instance, the estimated average number of daily close contacts per person in New York City (NYC) is 20; therefore, a 70% adherence level reduces the number of such contacts to 6 per person per day, leading to slower transmission. The number of close contacts and adherence to social distancing change by age group because social distancing literature and COVID-19–specific studies show that younger persons are more likely to have more contacts and lower adherence to social distancing measures than older persons (23, 24, 35–37).

We used a simple calibration procedure using earlier surveillance data from Dane County to fine-tune several input parameters that involve uncertainty (Appendix Table). We used the reported COVID-19 data from Dane County until 15 May 2020 to test whether our initial parameter estimates replicated the number of cases accurately. After this date, we modified the structure of the model to incorporate the age-specific number of close contacts and age-specific adherence inputs. We did not change any of the parameters after 31 July 2020 and compared the model's projections with the actual number of cases after this date.

Our objective was to modify as few parameters as possible to prevent overfitting. We used the same simulation settings as those in Dane County, except for 4 changes (Table 1): the epidemic was initiated with 3 exposed patients instead of 1; 6 imported cases were added to account for the larger population; demographic characteristics were adjusted using Milwaukee population data; and the adherence input was adjusted proportionately to cellphone mobility data, which indicated lower adherence in Milwaukee (31–33)

We did both a parametric and a structural sensitivity analysis for NYC. Our parametric sensitivity analysis tested the effect of uncertainty in 3 input parameters: probability of testing, transmission rates, and number of imported cases.

We developed an agent-based model of infection dynamics and preventive mitigation designed as a conceptual tool to give school districts basic insights into their options, and to provide optimal flexibility and computational ease as COVID-19 science rapidly evolved early in the pandemic.",Understanding the role of ___,"Policy guidelines/health behaviors (vaccination, masking, social distancing, stay at home, school closures)",Yes,"Our model helps policymakers consider how mitigation options and
the dynamics of school infection risks affect outcomes of interest. 

It had practical use early in the pandemic to surface dynamics for school districts and to enable manipulation of parameters as well as rapid update in response to changes in epidemiological conditions and scientific information about COVID-19 transmission dynamics, testing and vaccination resources, and reliability of mitigation strategies.

We used the model to assess key outcomes of interest to school district stakeholders, and we provided an online user interface to the model as a practical tool to empower school districts and their implementation partners to explore how various combinations and variations of strategy components affect health and learning outcomes within different underlying epidemiological conditions that could arise in the real world. This user interface can be accessed at https://agent-based-models. shinyapps.io/RegionalCOVIDSchoolSimulation/.

The model’s structure and dynamics are not limited to COVID-19. With appropriate adjustment of the parameter values representing transmission risks and infection characteristics, this model could be used to represent any infectious disease and adapted for other congregate settings, such as residential facilities.

To demonstrate how the model can be used to explore the effects of interventions, we tested the effects of changes in four parameters that could be affected by school policies: class size, frequency of surveillance testing, fraction of students tested in each surveillance sample (“sampling fraction”), and proportion of household adults vaccinated (Tables 1–4).

Periodic surveillance testing can also be performed universally or in a random sample of non-symptomatic individuals to identify pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Get tested,"Elements included distancing, health behaviors, surveillance and symptomatic testing, daily symptom and exposure screening, quarantine policies, and vaccination.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions (assume)
For example, under default assumptions, secondary infection rates and school attendance are substantially affected by surveillance testing protocols, vaccination rates, class sizes, and effectiveness of safety education.

In the analyses below, we assumed accuracy characteristics similar to PCR testing, but these parameters and testing frequency could be changed to represent antigen testing (15).

Starting from our default assumptions, in-school infections were most affected by changes in risk per infectious classmate, exogenous infection risk, exposure and symptoms screening sensitivity and specificity, likelihood of symptoms if infected, class size, number of non-distanced classmates in school, and biological test specificity, while attendance rates were most affected by changes in symptoms/exposure screening specificity, exogenous infection risk, biological test specificity, and vaccination rate.

Comparing different combinations of mitigation strategies, with varying assumptions about the accuracy of parent-reported symptoms and exposures, produced results in school infection and attendance that were not additive, and show stakeholders how implementation integrity in combination with elected mitigation strategies could affect outcomes of interest.

4.1. Limitations
Notably, it is not possible to fully validate the model; most studies of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission in U.S. schools are limited by lack of systematic testing, incomplete contact tracing, and details about mitigation procedures as well as adherence to them and their timing (10, 18–20).

This model represents this context with a large number of modifiable input parameters, but there are inevitably additional dynamics which are not included in the model.

None of these characteristics are implemented in the current model, for succinctness and due to limited resources for further extending the model, but they may play an important role in local transmission dynamics, particularly since these risk factors often co-occur with one another. We also made a simplifying assumption that vaccination and recovery from infection each independently confer complete, longterm immunity from future infection. At the time when this model was being developed (Q4 2020), this assumption was plausible.

We found that, without a territory-wide lockdown during the first COVID-19 outbreak in November 2020, the peak of infections would have been 4.7 times higher with a total of 5,404 (95% CrI: 5,015—5,798) infections before the start of vaccination on January 6, 2021. Without effective NPIs, we estimated a total of 4,290 (95% CrI: 3,880—4,708) infections during the second outbreak under the pace of vaccination administered in Nunavut. In a hypothetical accelerated vaccine rollout, the total infections during the second Nunavut outbreak would have been 58% lower, to 1,812 (95% CrI: 1,593—2,039) infections. Vaccination was estimated to have the largest impact during the outbreak in April 2021, averting 15,196 (95% CrI: 14,798—15,591) infections if the disease had spread through Nunavut communities. Accelerated vaccination would have further reduced the total infections to 243 (95% CrI: 222—265) even in the absence of NPIs.

We used a Bayesian non-parametric approach to back-calculate the time series of infections based on the daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut from November 6, 2020, to June 12, 2021. We then fitted the model to inferred infections.

Back calculation was implemented in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) setting using Nimble, with the R statistical environment acting as the front end. MCMC simulations were run in 5 independent chains with different initial conditions for !o, each consisting of 20,000 iterations, with a burn-in period of 10,000 iterations and a thinning factor of 10.

For the first outbreak of the pandemic in Nunavut in November 2020, we used the characteristics of the original Wuhan-I strain and determined the per-contact transmission probability (Table S1) by fitting the model to the temporal cumulative infections inferred from back-calculations during the exponential growth phase.

Simulation results were averaged over 500 independent Monte-Carlo realizations in each scenario, and credible intervals (CrI) were generated using the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method (with 500 replications).

For the inferred infections, we observed a peak of 15.6 (95% CrI: 8.5 to 24.0) cases on November 15, 2020, during the first community outbreak in Nunavut, three days before the territory-wide lockdown.

Without that lockdown, the model projected that Nunavut would have experienced a significantly larger outbreak with a peak incidence of 160 (95% CrI: 151—169) cases per day, which is approximately 4.7 times higher than the observed peak of 34 positive cases identified on November 17, 2020. We estimated that without a lockdown 13.5% (95% CrI: 12.5%—14.4%) of the total population would have experienced infection before the start of vaccination campaign on January 6, 2021 (Fig. 4A)

. We found that with NPIs and without vaccination, the outbreak would have caused 159 (95% CrI: 133—187) infections (Fig. 4B). For the counter-factual scenario of a hypothetical accelerated vaccine roll-out, the projected outbreak size was reduced to nearly half at 77 (95% CrI: 64—100) infections. However, were NPIs not enacted, the outbreak would have led to a substantially larger proportion of the population becoming infected, 4.7% (95% CrI: 4.1%—5.2%), with projected 1,812 (95% CrI: 1,593—2,039) infections even in the presence of accelerated vaccination. We estimated that, under the pace of vaccination administered in Nunavut, without NPIs, 11.0% (95% CrI: 9.9%—12.1) of the total population would have experienced infection, with a total of 4,290 (95% CrI: 3,880—4,708) infections.

In the counterfactual scenario of an accelerated immunization program and with NPIs in place, the outbreak was projected to have a significantly lower number of infections at 137 (95% CrI: 123—48) cases. However, without NPIs, the outbreak size in Iqaluit would have been 1.8 times larger, causing 243 (95% CrI: 222—265) infections even in the presence of accelerated vaccination, which is comparable to the actual toll of 253 cases reported between April 15 to May 28, 2021, in Iqaluit.

Implications of all the available evidence

Evidence so far points to the need for additional testing, contact tracing, and isolation of individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or who are considered to be at high risk of carrying infection because of their contact history or symptoms. Our study supports these conclusions and provides additional quantification of the amount of testing and tracing that would be needed to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 in the UK under different school reopening strategies.",Yes, UK,Considered and imposed,"Agent health behaviors (School reopenings) were based on scenario inputs.

(36 results)

We also assumed that reopening of schools would correspond to increases in workplace and community transmission probabilities, to account for increased social mixing with reopening of schools and relaxation of the physical distancing restrictions that have applied to work, leisure, and community activities. We assumed that if schools were to reopen full time or in a part-time rota system, the transmission probability in community settings would be respectively 90% or 70% of its pre-lockdown value when schools are in session and 70% during school holiday periods, and workplace transmission would be 70% of its pre-lockdown value during school terms (under the assumption that 30% remain working from home for foreseeable future; personal communication with policy decision makers) and 50% during school holidays. In addition, we assumed that if schools reopen in a part-time rota, this system would be in place for one school term (autumn term, 2020) only and then schools will go back full time from Jan 1, 2021 (table).

We assumed 100% sensitivity and specificity of the testing, a delay of 1 day to receive the test result, and that individuals testing positive would immediately be isolated for 14 days.

Assumptions + Limitations

Our analyses have some limitations. First, although we have made an effort to characterise the pandemic to resemble that of the UK, some of the parameters used are from various sources across different settings.[15] However, the main aspect we have focused on changing to illustrate different scenarios is the transmission probability of social (household, school, workplace, and community) contacts and the primary source for these data was UK based.[23] The changes we have simulated across scenarios reflect our understanding of possible options for school reopening as discussed in the UK. They are, therefore, fit for purpose within this analysis. Second, as with any modelling study, we have made a series of assumptions within the modelling framework. In particular, we made assumptions about the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that are symptomatic, as evidence in the literature is mixed. WHO suggests that 80% of people with infections show mild symptoms[24] and a study from the Italian city of Vo’ Euganeo[25] at the epicentre of the European pandemic confirms that a large proportion, 30–50%, of people with infections do not have symptoms; however, other studies suggest that this number is smaller—eg, 10% among children,[26] 18% among passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship,[27] and 42% among Japanese people returning from Wuhan.[28] There is currently a high degree of uncertainty around the proportion of asymptomatic infection, with evidence[29] suggesting that asymptomatic incidence ranges from 2% to 57%. We note, however, that many studies do not differentiate between presymptomatic and asymptomatic infection; instead the number reported is the proportion of individuals not exhibiting symptoms at the time of testing positive. Instead, in our model, we have assumed that asymptomatic infections account for 30% of onward-transmitted infections and that development of symptoms is age dependent. The assumption in this study, as in Covasim, is that 70% of infection is symptomatic and, guided by the findings by Davies and colleagues,[20] that the probability of developing clinical symptoms increases from around 20% in individuals aged younger than 20 years to around 69% in people aged older than 70 years. Future analyses will explore how changing the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections affects the impact of a test–trace–isolate strategy.

Some of our assumptions about the implementation of a test–trace–isolate strategy are likely to be optimistic in the UK context, so our finding should be interpreted as the minimal amount of testing that would be needed. In particular, we assume a 1-day delay after a test is done before results are communicated, that diagnosed individuals immediately isolate for 14 days with 90% efficacy, and that individuals displaying COVID-19-like symptoms will self-isolate with 50% efficacy until symptoms clear.

Furthermore, in the absence of robust data, we made assumptions (varied in the sensitivity analysis) about the infectiousness among children and young adults aged younger than 20 years. Future analysis might find that infectiousness among children is even lower than 50%, although there are no data suggesting higher transmission than in adults.[8] Finally, we note that in addition to simulating the current test–trace–isolate policy for the UK, we also simulated an additional level of tracing chosen to resemble a more pessimistic tracing level. We have chosen this level to be 40% as a modelling assumption. For both levels of tracing, 40% and 68%, simulated here, we determined the testing level required to avoid a second COVID-19 wave in the UK during 2020 and 2021. We note that we have not swept the entire testing and tracing level parameter space to explore regimes within the phase plane where R is less than 1 at all timepoints and hence a second wave is avoided, as this is beyond the scope of this work. Indeed, follow-up work on this is currently ongoing both for the UK and the USA.

We also have not modelled in this study the behaviour of young people who are not in school and, specifically, we have not assumed increased social mixing outside schools. Inclusion of this parameter is possible within our framework, but it is currently difficult to quantify. We can rerun the model when reliable estimates are available in future.",Yes,https://github. com/Jasminapg/Covid-19-Analysis,Yes,Covasim,Three or more different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Physical Sciences, Industry","Health Sciences, Mathematics (general), Statistics, Physics","Department of Applied Health Research and Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, UK (J Panovska-Griffiths DPhil)

To fit the model to the UK epidemic, we did an automated search for the optimal values of the number of infected people on Jan 21, 2020, the per-contact layer-dependent transmission probabilities, and the daily testing probabilities for symptomatic individuals (p) during May and June that minimised the sum of squared differences between the model’s estimates of confirmed cases and deaths, and data on these same two indicators between Jan 21 and June 17, 2020, collated from the UK Government’s COVID-19 dashboard. 

In view of the uncertainties in the role of different age groups in transmission,[8] we simulated the same scenarios in a sensitivity analysis, in which transmissibility for people aged younger than 20 years was assumed to be half that of people older than 20 years.[20] As part of this analysis, the model was recalibrated and equivalent analysis to the main one undertaken (appendix pp 5, 7–9).",Yes,"In a sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated infectiousness of children and young adults aged younger than 20 years at 50% relative to older ages (20 years and older).

The baseline scenario of control measures included: (i) isolation of symptomatic residents with hospitalization of a proportion who developed severe illness; (ii) screening of staff for symptomatic illness followed by isolation; (iii) cohorting of care providers; and (iv) mask-wearing by all staff. We assumed that all staff wore surgical masks during their shift, but switched to an N95 respirator when caring for isolated residents

Routine testing. To prevent disease importation and transmission during the silent asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic stages of infection, we implemented routine nasopharyngeal (NP) and saliva PCR testing of staff with a frequency of 7 days (Iacobucci, 2020). The probability of case detection at the time of testing post-infection was determined by the temporal diagnostic sensitivity (Zhang et al., 2021) inferred from fitting a sensitivity function to the percent positivity data of NP testing (Miller et al., 2020). Both tests were assumed to have a specificity of 100%. We considered time delays of 24-48 hours in turnaround time from sampling to results, during which staff continued their shifts. Staff isolated for a period of 14 days following a positive result, during which they were excluded from interactions in the LTCF, and substitutes were included.

We did not include visitation by community members in the model during the outbreak, which may be allowed with specific guidelines for visitors. We also did not include other modes of disease transmission such as aerosolization of the virus without adequate ventilation. For evaluation of routine testing, we assumed a 100% compliance rate among staff. While this may be a reasonable assumption for non-invasive, self-administered saliva testing, compliance will likely be affected by practical challenges of relatively invasive NP testing. We assumed that staff cohorting can be effectively and sustainably implemented as described; however, staff shortages and the use of overtime to replace staff may affect the effectiveness of this strategy.

We assumed that infection was introduced into the LTCF through infected staff during the silent asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic stages of disease.

We assumed that recovery from a primary infection provided adequate immunity for the remainder of the simulation, preventing re-infection.

The clear communication of these modelled results was a central feature of the Victorian Government’s justification of its adopted strategy and they were publicly released in conjunction with its announcement of the Victorian Government’s ‘Roadmap for Reopening’.18,19,38

We also built it to be flexible enough to be rapidly adapted and tuned to a broad range of domestic and international demographic and policy scenarios.

This work and its adoption by policy-makers in real-world public-health policymaking is a demonstrable example of an incorporation of complexity science in public health that has been consistently called for in the public health, systems, and complexity modelling literature,40,41 but that has so far produced few tangible examples.

Our model code continues to evolve, is open for use and adaptation by any other jurisdiction around the world who may wish to use or adapt it for their own immediate and/or longer-term planning purposes (https://bit.ly/2XI3v3z).

Already, this has resulted in considerable improvements in speed (>1000x original) and design that will continue to be openly documented in the model’s ODD protocol and online repository as well as online policy and decision support tools developed with co-authors and collaborators (e.g. https:// populationinterventions.science.unimelb.edu. au/pandemic-trade-offs-july-2021).

Limitations
A limitation of our findings is the level of uncertainty associated with results.

Further limitations and challenges section
Despite this, the model also omits many potentially important factors. It does not include changes to individual hygiene behaviours (hand washing and cough etiquette, etc) or associated environmental transfer that may alter rates of transmission (e.g. through surfaces). Further, it also does not include accurate geographic representation of towns, cities, or other locations whose proximity may alter transmission patterns (e.g. commuting or transport routes). Its representation of demographic and workplace heterogeneity is also limited. It, therefore, remains an abstraction in many respects. However, it has been built flexibly and can be extended to include adjustments to assumptions or inclusion of these and other public health considerations such as school and public transport closures, mask-wearing, expansion of tracking, tracing and testing regimes, changes to the understanding of the demographic, workforce, and movement patterns given new empirical data (e.g. linear vs. exponential decays), and advances in the use of digital technologies for rapid and more efficient contact tracing.46

As model authors and contributors, we worked closely with representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services to construct and deploy new, policy-relevant functions and features, sometimes under extreme time pressure.

Finally, we also acknowledge that real-world evidence also indicates that some assumptions governing behaviour and mechanisms – especially in our Wave 1 conceptualisation – did not operate in the model as they did in the real world.

Therefore, to design countermeasures for stop spreading an epidemic disease as well as sustaining our economic activities, we should introduce constraints on the maximal allowed numbers of people we can see for each day for each person by looking for an optimal contact network for day t that maximally stimulates our economies

The vaccination scenarios resulted in only marginal reductions in Long Covid cases and this is because the model conservatively assumes that vaccinations do not reduce the risk of Long Covid.

Since Covid-19 is still a very active area of research, the model is inevitably limited by data gaps. In particular, the maximum duration of Long Covid is currently uncertain and there is no clear data describing who may be most susceptible to developing Long Covid symptoms [61]. All modelled individuals therefore currently have the same probability of developing Long Covid. There are also inherent uncertainties when it comes to predicting the long-term effects of a disease that has only been prevalent in society for a short period of time, as these long-term predictions cannot be validated.

For this analysis, we simulated the movement from the community by agents representing patients into 104 short-term acute-care hospitals over 1 month. At each daily time step, agents had a probability of entering as a patient for COVID-19 or a different primary indication.",Yes,"Testing

A Canadian government report and
several preprint studies report antigen test sensitivity for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 ο (omicron) variant as ranging from 37.1 to 97.6%.[26–30] Within the main analysis, we assumed a test sensitivity of 67.4% (the middle of this range) for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 ο (omicron) variant in asymptomatic individuals using antigen testing and performed a sensitivity analysis decreasing this number. PCR testing was assumed to have a test sensitivity of 77% for asymptomatic infection.[31,32] We assumed a test specificity of 98%, the negative percentage agreement required for approval by the FDA for both antigen and PCR testing.[26]

Vaccination

Recent studies have reported that although receipt of a booster dose confers ∼50% vaccine effectiveness against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 ο (omicron) variant, marked waning of immunity against infection was seen for those without a booster (ie, not up to date) with, on average, only 7% protection against infection.[35–37] As of January 5, 2022, 37% of the vaccinated population of North Carolina had received a booster dose.[38] Therefore, we implemented a weighted vaccine effectiveness against infection parameter (24%), which accounted for 37% of the vaccinated population having a booster. This calculation resulted in 50% effectiveness against infection and 63% having 7% effectiveness against infection.

Vaccination also increased the likelihood of being asymptomatic if infected.[39] For reported cases, we assumed that 5% of the unvaccinated and 25% of the vaccinated population were asymptomatic. Reported asymptomatic cases would represent cases detected through work-based surveillance or through school- or office-based testing for close contacts. Given the lack of evidence for nonreported cases, we assumed that 25% of the unvaccinated and 50% of the vaccinated population were asymptomatic. Due to uncertainty around this parameter, we increased the proportion of asymptomatic cases by 50% in a sensitivity analysis.

Vaccination decreased the likelihood of developing severe illness and hospitalization. Using data on hospital admissions for COVID-19, which included vaccination status, we replicated historical admissions. Overall, 69% of individuals hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 were unvaccinated, in line with national trends.

We assumed that the testing policies were implemented uniformly across all hospitals.

We focused on asymptomatic screening
because we assumed that those with mild and moderate infections would be identified through verbal screening and that those with severe and critical infections would be admitted for COVID-19 treatment.[8]

Within the main analysis, we assumed a test sensitivity of 67.4% (the middle of this range) for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 ο (omicron) variant in asymptomatic individuals using antigen testing and performed a sensitivity analysis decreasing this number. PCR testing was assumed to have a test sensitivity of 77% for asymptomatic infection.[31,32] We assumed a test specificity of 98%, the negative percentage agreement required for approval by the FDA for both antigen and PCR testing.[26] We additionally assumed that 30% of individuals who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection within the previous 90 days but had since recovered would test positive using PCR testing (ie, persistent positivity) due to persistent viral shedding rather than true reinfection.[33,34]

For reported cases, we assumed that 5% of
the unvaccinated and 25% of the vaccinated population were asymptomatic. Reported asymptomatic cases would represent cases detected through work-based surveillance or through school- or office-based testing for close contacts. Given the lack of evidence for nonreported cases, we assumed that 25% of the unvaccinated and 50% of the vaccinated population were asymptomatic. Due to uncertainty around this parameter, we increased the proportion of asymptomatic cases by 50% in a sensitivity analysis.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. Our model simulated entry into the hospital environment based on discharge data and therefore only included inpatient stays. Individuals entering the hospital environment for outpatient or emergency department care or visitation were not modeled. Testing was less likely for these individuals and relies on other mitigation strategies to decrease the risk of nosocomial transmission. We assumed that between 5% (unvaccinated) and 25% (vaccinated) of infected individuals would be asymptomatic. Initial studies of the SARS-CoV-2 ο (omicron) variant suggest that the proportion of asymptomatic infection may be much higher, with estimates up to 80%.[2] However, this evidence is still preliminary, and we chose to incorporate a more conservative assumption and to test a higher rate of asymptomatic infection within a sensitivity analysis. We did not model differing vaccine effectiveness dependent on timing of doses or immunosuppression. In addition, the pediatric population was grouped within the “under 50” age group, even though certain ages were ineligible to receive a vaccine. Lastly, we did not model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, we could not simulate cases of SARS-CoV-2 resulting from a nosocomial outbreak.",Yes,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6141066,Yes,Modeling Infection Diseases in Healthcare Network (MInD-Healthcare),Two different disciplines,"Life Sciences, Industry",Health Sciences,"RTI International, Research Triangle, North Carolina

For example, is social distancing more effective than the isolation of symptomatic cases? Is a lockdown the most effective option to reduce infection numbers? How useful are masks relative to the aforementioned strategies?

2.2.2. Ranges of analysis variables 
Recall that in this research paper, the four main independent vari­ables of interest are mask usage, social distancing, lockdown and isolation of symptomatic cases. ",Yes,"Hence, this model assumes that it took just 7 days to tighten border controls. To model imported COVID-19 cases, 2 out of 10000 people are randomly infected every week from day 7. Very soon after tightening borders, Hong Kong began enforcing a curfew, closing down many big tourist attractions and closing down the high-speed rail to China [55,56]. Hence, after another week, the lock down parameter was enabled from day 14 with a relatively high number of intra-city travellers and essential workers, resembling a semi-lockdown. After three months, Hong Kong began easing its border control by giving quarantine exemptions to people who met certain conditions [57], and this is modelled in the simulation by increasing the number of randomly infected people from 2 per week to 10 per week after day 120. Simultaneously, Hong Kong began gradually easing its curfew by partially reopening public facilities [58,59] and increasing the 8 people rule to 50. This is modelled in the simulation by disabling the lockdown and social distancing on day 126. After approximately three weeks, the government tightened their borders again, including banning flights from India [60], which is replicated by reducing the randomly selected weekly infections from 10 to 2 again. Also, a semi-lockdown was enforced again, which is repli cated in the model by re-enabling social distancing and total lockdown.

Italy almost immediately stopped all the direct flights from China, whilst keeping all other flights open. Hence, the initial random number of infections per week is set to 25. Not many people are initially aware of the virus and many thought it was a com mon cold until awareness was raised via media [62]. Hence, the initial symptomatic isolation rate is set at 30%, and later raised to 60% in the 3rd day, and 90% on the seventh day after people became increasingly aware of the virus. As the virus quickly became out of control, Italy began closing some cities [63], which is modelled by enabling city confinement on the 7th day. Schools also closed soon afterwards [63], which increases social distancing. Hence, this is modelled by increasing the social distancing metres to 0.5, also on the 7th day. Note that although cities are confined, essential workers can still travel between cities. The government then began strictly enforcing 1 m of social distancing [64], which is modelled by increasing the social distancing metres to 1 on the 10th day. Although the rate of infections has reduced, the curve was still rising, and Italy further increased their safety measures by enforcing mobility restrictions, followed by a total lockdown [63]. This is implemented in the model by increasing the social distancing metres to 1.5 on day 12 and enabling total lockdown as well as decreasing the random infections to 6 per week on day 15 respectively. This gradually stopped the increase of cases, and the curve quickly dropped, similar to the real data. After an extended period of lockdown, the government began reopening public facilities and relaxing the lockdown rules [65], which is modelled by ending the total lockdown and reducing the social distancing threshold to 1.0 m. This caused the rate of reduction to slow down. Eventually, Italy partially reopened its borders to some neighbouring European countries [66], which is modelled in the simulation by increasing the random weekly infection to 15 per week.

3.4.3.1. Validation setup. Initially, the United Kingdom approached the pandemic with the herd immunity strategy [68], where minimal coun termeasures were used except for raising awareness of the virus and encouraging people with symptoms to self-isolate at home. Hence, the experiment was set up with no social distancing as well as a mask usage rate of only 5% [69]. Initially, there was very little awareness of the virus and many people still went outside despite feeling symptoms, thinking it was a common flu. Hence the initial symptomatic isolation rate was set to 30%. The UK airport was fully open during the start of COVID-19, hence to model imported COVID-19 cases, 40 out of 10000 people are randomly infected every week initially. For the first 9 days, no significant changes were made in the simu lation model except that the symptomatic isolation rate was increased to 60% on day 3, and then to 90% on day 7, as people become more aware of COVID-19. Eventually, the government abandoned the herd immunity strategy and began partially closing public facilities and encouraging 2 m of social distancing. To model this in the simulation, the social distancing metres was increased to 2. The UK then went into full lockdown and further tightened its bor ders, which was modelled in the simulation by enforcing a total lock down and reducing the number of random infections from 40 per week to 6, from day 15. Approximately 2 weeks after the peak [70], the UK began partially easing its lockdown rules and more people began going outside. This is modelled by decreasing the social distancing metres to 1.5 from day 28. Border controls were eventually more lenient as neighbouring countries saw a drop in COVID-19 cases, and this is modelled by increasing the random infections from 6 to 18, from day 38. Eventually, the UK dropped the lockdown rule and reopened most of its facilities, which is modelled by decreasing the social distancing metres to 0.5 and disabling the total lockdown.",,,,,,,,,,,Yes,NetLogo,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions ""assum""

The experiments in this paper assume the use of surgical masks and hence the mask penetration rate used in the model is 44%. 

As the simulation model assumes that only individuals with serious symptoms can die, we calculated the adjusted fatality rate for each age group in our simulation based on real-life infection fatality ratio (IFR) in the 3rd column of Table 2, which was also obtained from the study by Verity et al. [21].

3.4.1.1. Validation setup
Having experienced the SARS outbreak in 2003, Hong Kong took a more cautious approach compared to the UK and Italy in their COVID-19 strategy since the beginning [54]. Hence this model assumes 1.5 m of social distancing and 99% mask usage from day 0. 

Hong Kong imposed strict border restrictions very soon after the initial case [36]. Hence, this model assumes that it took just 7 days to tighten border controls.

Whilst the proposed model can produce a reasonably fair estimation of the general trend of COVID-19 as well as the effectiveness of certain preventative measures, the model needs to take into account more real-life factors for it to be used by policy makers to make key decisions. 

One could extend this model in the future by adding features such as small venues, schools and transport, which will allow the model to make even more realistic predictions.

Assumptions (implied)

We deliberately did not use the actual rate of vaccination of each city during the epidemic, so we can directly estimate the effects of demographics, unconfounded by other factors. Individuals who were susceptible, asymptomatic, latent, or incubating post-latent at the time of vaccination were eligible for vaccination. However, individuals that recovered from an asymptomatic infection were not vaccinated. Although this might not reflect reality under policies not testing for antibodies before vaccination, the effect should not be substantial: asymptomatic infections are more common in individuals below the age of 18 [(47); see Supplementary Table 1 for details], who were not in the age group eligible for vaccination in this simulation. Furthermore, in this simulation framework, individuals were immediately immunized after receiving the vaccine, not reflecting the actual time until immunity, approximately 1–2 weeks (48, 49). Thus, a correction for the delayed immunity was implemented by shifting the vaccination timeline by a week (i.e., individuals scheduled to be vaccinated at time t were actually vaccinated at time t + 7).

Assumptions + limitations

We also note that our assumed form of VE imposes potential limitations on the generalizability of our study. Since we model vaccination by moving individuals directly to the recovered compartment, our model refers to vaccination as equally efficient against infections and developing severe disease given infection. Consequently, our study is mainly relevant for scenarios where VE is similar with respect to both of these outcomes. Indeed, this assumption held in the initial vaccination campaigns against the first SARS-CoV-2 variants (42–44).

The strategies relate to node immunization (network node removal) or breaking of social ties (network edge removal) and are actuated either at a network level (governing authority decision) or a node level (individual decision).

Null model: A fraction αn of nodes is removed uniformly at random

It is important to note that this is a network-level intervention strategy, where a national authority determines a set of individuals to immune (or request to quarantine) based on an estimate of their relative risk

We can therefore, for simplicity and without loss of generality, assume that individuals move in a finite 2-dimensional Euclidean space R2 and not on the surface of the Earth. This assumption allows to approximate geodesic distances on Earth with Euclidean distances in R2, a common practice in many real-world algorithms and services.

We assume that an object might appear and disappear multiple times during the observation time interval 

An underlying assumption of R0 is that the disease is spreading in a perfect mixing network (i.e., a complete graph) or a regular tree network – a special type of a network topology that has no cycles and each internal node has a constant number of children, defined by a branching factor d

The first class, assumes a large, homogeneously mixing population where individuals move between compartments at certain transition rates described by ordinary differential equations

The second class, assumes heterogeneity of population and is based on an agent-based SEIR model, where each agent is representing an individual

The model assumes that individuals are in position to understand that they should avoid contacts that are frequently and regularly interacting with many others (e.g., due to their occupation or mobility habits)

This is an individual-level intervention strategy, where each individual makes a local decision about who to keep in its social bubble, based on some understanding of how many friends they have in common. This is a relatively easier assumption to make (than the one made by the targeted model A).

To evaluate the effect of quarantine, we incorporate a quarantine parameter q in the experiments that represents the proportion of infected individuals that will have no contact with any others until they fully recover; we assume that the rest 1 − q proportion of the infected nodes will not quarantine and will continue interacting with others (e.g., due to no symptoms).

An inherent limitation of our model is that it assumes availability of trajectories of individuals through digital tracing technologies.

While we are confident that we adequately developed the agent-based model, we would like to point out some limitations of our study:

Text:
As individual agents may refuse to participate in preventive testing measures, compliance to testing measures was defined as an additional agent property that was randomly assigned to each agent independent of their role with a certain probability given by the corresponding parameter. Non-compliant agents were not tested for strategies that imposed regular testing on the clinic population, i.e., for the third and fourth strategies. However, all agents were assumed to be compliant to isolation based on symptoms or a positive test result as this was the case in the actual clinic

A population fully compliant to active surveillance testing is not guaranteed in an application setting. Therefore, the impact of varying levels of compliance with regular preventive testing measures in the clinic population was investigated. Different test frequencies were analysed using the best guess parameters and assuming established baseline surveillance and entry testing. Figure 4C shows the resulting outbreak probability for different frequencies and varying levels of compliance relative to the outbreak probability of the strategy without additional testing. Increasing compliance from 60 to 100% of the population decreased the outbreak probability by 24% if testing was conducted once weekly and by 91% if testing was conducted daily.

This is achieved by conducting a comprehensive set of sensitivity analyses of parameters and various structural assumptions presented in an easily accessible form.

Each simulation was subject to a set of parameter assumptions; the sets of parameters used in this study were extracted from the literature and are summarized in Table  1.

The resulting distributions of these durations are visualized in Fig. 2A assuming best guess parameters.

Once an agent is quarantined, the agent was assumed to be non-infectious during the time of isolation. While this is likely not entirely realistic, this is a decent approximation in the light of the multitude of other, more critical modelling assumptions.

However, all agents were assumed to be compliant to isolation based on symptoms or a positive test result as this was the case in the actual clinic.

Variations of parameter assumptions affect the outbreak probability for different strategies similarly.

Conducting baseline surveillance compared to no surveillance at all reduced the probability of an outbreak by 49% assuming best guess parameters. This result lacked robustness to many parameter assumptions, ranging between values of 32 to 68%. Notably, this result was sensitive to assumptions on parameters which are important to the efficacy of symptom-based surveillance, such as the proportion of asymptomatic cases (AsymptomaticFraction), the timing of the peak of infectiousness (PeakInfectiousness), the reproduction number (R0) and the success rate of symptomatic screening (IsolationFraction).

In order to demonstrate possible effects, the different surveillance strategies were simulated for delays of tdel ∈ [0,1,2]days in contrast to the previous analyses which assumed immediate availability of test results. Assuming previously demonstrated robustness of results, simulation runs were evaluated under the best guess parameters for all considered delays and all surveillance strategies.

To this end, outbreaks have been simulated for the four defined strategies assuming best guess parameters and the outbreak probability for outbreak sizes Nout ∈[2,3,4,5] has been evaluated.

Different test frequencies were analysed using the best guess parameters and assuming established baseline surveillance and entry testing.

A comprehensive sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the obtained results under varying assumptions about a set of uncertain parameters, representing alternative epidemiological parameters as well as alternative structural assumptions.

The value of these performance measures will vary between manufacturers, virus variants and the quality of the sample, such that the model results are to be interpreted in the light of the assumed test characteristics. While from a mathematical point of view it is legitimate to consider diagnostic tests with low sensitivities, surveillance with only low-sensitivity tests is unreasonable in the context of the case-ascertainment process assumed in the model.

The results for the expected reduction of the outbreak probability are robust to most epidemiological parameter assumptions, the exact parameter values employed are stated in Table 1.

The relative reduction of outbreak probability by entry, once weekly and twice weekly testing relative to the symptom-based baseline strategy is displayed in Fig. 3 for all parameter combinations relevant to the 1-way sensitivity analysis.

The best guess outbreak probability reductions were mostly robust to variations of parameters and the large number of simulations conducted lead to narrow stochastic uncertainties. The sensitivity of the diagnostic test and compliance of the clinic population critically determined the efficacy of the strategy.

Notably, this result was sensitive to assumptions on parameters which are important to the efficacy of symptom-based surveillance, such as the proportion of asymptomatic cases (AsymptomaticFraction), the timing of the peak of infectiousness (PeakInfectiousness), the reproduction number (R0) and the success rate of symptomatic screening (IsolationFraction).

However, the 1-way sensitivity analysis provides easily interpretable outcomes and introduces no additional bias compared to probabilistic sensitivity analyses, which require the specification of poorly known parameter probability distributions [25].

Additionally, the input parameters of the simulation model can be easily customised for different infectious disease scenarios, allowing its use in other pandemics or conditions where HCWs could be unavailable. Moreover, these models can be shared with other health systems where they can manipulate facility-specific numbers (beds, locations, number of HCWs, etc.) to match their needs.

Data, assumptions, and model development

The primary reason for this was that we assume that clinicians are masked and protected in the OR, whereas they might not be in the recovery room and workstation.

The average number of interactions required per patient is based on the HCW type, where we assume nurses have more contact with patients on average than anaesthetists.

While it could be possible that there might be no interaction between each HCW, we assume they could interact while passing by inpatient beds, workstations, lockers, or while passing by ORs.

We considered all HCWs as the susceptible population at the beginning of the simulation and assumed they could be infected by either patients or other HCWs.

Specifically, an HCW is assumed to have the option to switch facilities and/or groups every week but will work at the same facility each week.

Limitations
Finally, we would like to point out a few limitations of this study. First, the analysis and results are based on simulated findings as opposed to empirical results.

Another limitation is that we assume that each patient, on average, comes in contact with a provider a certain number of times, and providers interact with each other at a particular rate. Although these assumptions are based on expert opinions from anaesthesiologists working in the partner hospital, including the second author, we recognise the fact that the number of actual interactions could be higher in the OR when HCWs could be in close contact most of the time, or lower while providing care on inpatient beds, depending on the scenario.

Another limitation is associated with modelling and replicating the partner hospital’s activities.

While physicians were involved throughout the model development process to replicate the actions, we acknowledge that certain assumptions (interactions) and simplifications of complex workflow in the model could limit the ability to replicate the activities at the partner hospital completely.

Finally, the time until provider availability after infection is based on recovery time and the isolation guidelines from the CDC, but we recognise that some hospitals may have different practices, and these durations might vary.",No,,No,,Two different disciplines,"Engineering, Life Sciences","Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Biological and Biomedical Sciences","1.

In the cases simulated in this work, we use a value of = 0.2 for a “normal” variant and we assume > 0.2 for more transmissible variants [37].

The state of infection in an individual remains for a maximum of 1/ = 14 days. It is assumed that the potential for infecting another person does not change during this period.

Our model assumes that visitors arrive and leave the city every day. The number of visitors coming and leaving each day is around 1/1000 of the total residents.

In this work, as usual in computer simulations, we assumed some simplifications and assumptions in order to optimize the model, and to capture the most significant possibilities according to some objectives. One of these simplifications is the absence of traffic and commuting, i.e., the time required for displacement. The introduction of a transportation network could improve the model, and is likely to bring new features to the study. Another limitation of our work is the population structure. In our “city” model, the population does not have any age or gender structure. For COVID-19, it is known that the response to infection can vary depending on the infected age; thus, the use of an age-structure AMB-SIR model also could bring more realism to the simulation. Finally, our work assumes that all variants are affected equally by vaccinations, which does not reflect the real-life situation. Thus, adding different responses to the vaccine–variant interaction could strongly improve the model. Similar to other models, as we have discussed, we tried to shed some light on the main effects of the dynamics. On the other hand, the assumptions we made in order to allow a feasible but simplified model to run expectations of the effects caused by an effective vaccination program allowed us to test the difference between having or not having an effective vaccination program in an open-to-migration city during an evolving pandemic. Thus, our model considered a successional dynamic of variants with distinct life traits. Even the simplifications we assumed did not undermine the effectiveness of vaccines, considering we built up a more vulnerable society (where everybody was equally susceptible) combined with realistic combinations of lethal-transmissible variants.

Sensitivity exercises",Yes,"For simplicity, we assume that strains do not interact with each other and therefore spread independently.

Epidemiological parameters characterising eHCoVs and the pHCoV (SARS-CoV-2) were informed, where possible, from the existing literature.

We investigated the impact of the remaining parameters numerically, leveraging available epidemiological know ledge about eHCoVs to guide our analysis. Values defining the life-expectancy distribution were set to simulate age profiles matching average European patterns (simulated age profiles are shown in Fig. S1 of Additional file 1 [10, 41–49]). Model parameters and their values are briefly summarised in Table S1 of Additional file 1, while details about model implementation and calibration are found in Additional file 1

We set susceptibility to reinfection to ρ = 0.35 in order for our model to yield a realistic FOI for eHCoVs. That is, we calibrated ρ as to match empirical estimates of the age at first eHCoV infection (Fig. 2) [50], which is given by the inverse of the FOI [51]

At time t = Tinv = 160 years we randomly infect 10 individuals with the pHCoV (red). Inset: zoom on the first 100 days after the introduction of the pHCoV. b Annual attack rate per 100 population by age class for all four eHCoVs. The attack rate decreases and plateaus with age since individuals accumulate immunity through consecutive infections with different eHCoVs

The dashed line and shaded area represent respectively the mean and 95% C.I. for the age at first infection with any eHCoV obtained from a pooled estimate [50]. b 5th percentile of the time (measured in years) between consecutive infections by the same strain. Hatches indicate the ρ > 1/R0 region (for R0 = 2) where the dynamics are Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible-like (whereas for ρ < 1/R0 we observe epidemic behaviour). It should be noted that for ρ = 0 reinfection still occurs in our model because of external introductions, which we have assumed for simplicity to ignore pre-existing immunity to reinfection. Nonetheless, reinfection events induced by external introductions represent only a small fraction of all infection events. Epidemiological parameters are set to baseline values

Furthermore, very small values of ρ provide unrealistic age-specific incidence profiles. In the extreme case ρ = 0 (no reinfection), infections would occur only in older children and young adults, contradicting empirical evidence of eHCoVs infecting older age classes [50]. Finally, we note that values of ρ > 1/R0 cause a shift from an epidemic Susceptible-Infected Recovered-like behaviour to a stable Susceptible Infected-Susceptible-like behaviour [53], suggesting values of ρ beyond ρc (indicated with hatches in Fig. 2) are not epidemiologically plausible in the context of eHCoV dynamics.

The parameter a (baseline risk) represents the score in HCoV-naive individuals, b represents the variation in severity score after infection with any eHCoV and r (waning of cross-protection) is the rate at which eHCoV-priming-induced protection against severe COVID-19 wanes over time.

We obtain a good qualitative match to observed trends in hospitalisation rates and the age distribution of hospitalised cases (Fig. 4a, b). In particular, the model seems to capture the relatively low rates observed in individuals aged 0–20 years and the rapid increase in hospitalisation rates after the age of 20. Age variations in severity scores (Fig. 4c) underscore the important role of loss of cross-protection to disease through repeated eHCoVs infections throughout life

Shaded area indicates the 95% C.I. from simulations. Here, we set π = 0.05, a = 1.5, b = 0.5, r = 0.05 years−1 . Because our aim is mainly to illustrate the role of disease enhancement and cross-protection, we did not attempt to fit parameters a (baseline risk), b (boosting factor), and r (waning of cross-protection). Rather, we manually adjusted parameters in order to obtain a good visual agreement between data and simulations. Goodness of fit for chosen parameters was measured at R2 = 0.98. Results are averaged over 100 samplings from each of 50 different simulations. Other parameters are set to baseline values

Figure 5a shows that such a model is able to capture the observed COVID-19 hospitalisation rates (R2 = 0.99), under the explicit assumption that individuals younger than A0 = 20 years are protected from severe symptoms. However, while both HCoV-exposure-dependent and age-dependent mechanisms seem to perform equally well in terms of age aggregated data, they yield different predictions about the individual risk of severe disease (Fig. 5b). In particular, the former model predicts a small but non-negligible proportion of young individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19, whereas the age-dependent model does not. Figure 5c shows that 

heterogeneity in exposure to eHCoVs results in a fraction of young individuals displaying a severity score comparable to older individuals. In contrast, in the age-dependent scenario, younger hosts display a systematically smaller and non-overlapping severity score compared to older ones (Fig. 5d), requiring ad hoc assumptions on why the severe disease can sporadically but still significantly happen in this age group.

Fig. 5 Implications of HCoV-exposure- and age-dependent-severity. a A model where disease severity depends only on age (the age-dependent model) is able to explain hospitalisation rates in EU/EEA countries and the UK (dots). Line and filled area represent mean and 95% C.I., respectively. Here, we set aage = 0.4, bage = 0.052 years−1 and A0 = 20 years, after calibrating the model to hospitalisation data in EU/EEA countries and the UK. Results are averaged over 100 samplings from each of 50 different simulations. b Individual risk of developing severe symptoms under exposure-dependent (black) and the age-dependent severity (fuchsia). c, d Severity score distribution within each age class under exposure-dependant and age-dependent severity, respectively. Solid and dashed lines indicate the median score and the 95% percentile range, respectively. Note that c, d have different scales. To estimate individual risk in b, we first selected N ¼ 3 % 104 individuals completely at random in a single simulation (that is, we assume uniform infection rates across all age ranges) and then sampled a fraction π = 0.05 of these N cases according to the sampling scheme outlined in the “Methods” section. This operation was repeated 2 · 103 times. Finally, we computed the proportion of high-risk individuals as the fraction of sampled cases whose risk is larger than the 25th percentile in the > 60 years age range. In c, d, the score distribution is computed from a single simulation at the time of the introduction of the pHCoV. We set epidemiological parameters to their baseline values and a = 1.5, b = 0.5, r = 0.05 years−1

We note that our exposure-dependent model can qualitatively capture this behaviour. The exposure-dependent model allows a small but non-negligible proportion of the young to be at increased risk of severe disease at levels comparable to that of older individuals due to their immunity status (Fig. 5). Further to this point, and although data is limited, the age distribution of severe eHCoVs infections contrasts with the age distribution of severe COVID-19, following a pattern of reduction in se verity through repeated exposure (Fig. S7 of Additional file 1)."

This rate of travelers passing through quarantine was chosen to match the average number of international arrivals per week, rounded to the nearest thousand (27). The branching process model then assumes a community reproductive ratio of 1.5, reduced by a factor of 2 to account for ongoing public health and social measures in the Australian context.

(37 results)

We assume that transmission within the quarantine system is mitigated substantially through infection control measures (we explore the relaxation of this assumption in our sensitivity analysis). With respect to disease surveillance in the quarantine workforce, our model assumes that staff attending to the quarantine facility are tested on each day they visit the site, but not on days off.

Our results demonstrate how the quarantine system would perform under different conditions of vaccine efficacy and viral transmissibility under fixed assumptions with respect to details such as test schedules and quarantine duration (see the Supplementary Materials).

We examine the sensitivity of our results to several of our main assumptions including (i) the disease incubation period, (ii) the decomposition of vaccine efficacy into different components, (iii) the proportion of cases expressing symptoms, and (iv) the effectiveness of infection control measures within quarantine systems.

Breach events can be caused by infected workers or travelers, and we assume that, because of frequent testing, worker-related breach events are always observed

In our outbreak simulations, we implement population vaccination as a static coverage level (proportion vaccinated) that we independently vary, not as dynamically increasing coverage. Furthermore, for each outbreak scenario, we assume that all vaccinated individuals have been given a vaccine with the same efficacy and no waning of immunity has occurred. The results should therefore be interpreted as “snapshots” of risk, for each given set of conditions.

For the branching process scenarios, a fixed traveler arrival rate of 3000 per week was assumed, with an infection prevalence of 10%. This differed from the inflow assumptions of the quarantine model (50 travelers per week, 1% infection prevalence), so a scaling factor was used to linearly adjust the breach rate produced by the quarantine model (see methods in the Supplementary Materials). This scaling approximation assumes linear dependence of the quarantine breach rate with incoming arrival infection prevalence of up to 10%, an assumption we verified in the context of the quarantine model.

In our main analysis, we used an estimate of psymp = 0.67 symptomatic infection probability. In the supporting information, we relax this assumption...

In our model of the quarantine system, we assume that transmission is mitigated substantially between travelers in different groups (to 1%), between travelers and workers (to 1%), and between workers (to 10% of the uncontrolled transmission rate). 

The model assumes that one-third of all cases are asymptomatic (this assumption is relaxed in a sensitivity analysis; see the Supplementary Materials).

Here, we assume that breakthrough cases are just as contagious as infections in unvaccinated individuals. That is, we assume that the vaccine acts primarily to protect those immunized from infection (VT = 0, VI = VE). While there is evidence for reduced periods of viral shedding in vaccinated individuals, peak viral loads appear to be similar (37). Therefore, we have presented the results based on a conservative assumption that can be relaxed or modified as new evidence emerges (see the Supplementary Materials for a sensitivity analysis given an alternate assumption that VT = VE and VI = 0).

Limitations (implied)

However, we do not explicitly simulate the age of individuals, and so our model is not equipped to assess the ramifications of case isolation policies in the context of families. That is, our model as implemented cannot account for situations in which isolation of a case would require the separation of children from their parents or legal guardians. The choice not to fully isolate cases in these situations could result in a higher level of transmission. In addition, young children may not be eligible for vaccination, which is not accounted for in the model as parameterized for this work.

As noted by Grout et al. (26), the observed rate of breach events can vary substantially between regions, even when similar quarantine arrangements are in place. Even if we assume perfect disease surveillance and reporting, the small number of recorded events makes high-confidence calibration to “ground-truth” breach rates infeasible. Therefore, the present work focuses on evaluating the performance of a uniform quarantine policy based on globally accepted guidelines, applied over a wide range of viral transmissibility, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine coverage parameter values, to provide useful relative comparisons between scenarios.",Yes,"Source code for the individual-based models of COVID-19 and the raw data used

We assume that CI is implemented from the start day of the epidemic, as has been the case in Australia and most other countries.

We assume that universities are partially open and 10% of university students continue to travel to universities in this scenario.

Quarantined family members (QF)
In the case of existence, we assume that the strategy is implemented from the day of finding the first case in New South Wales (NSW), on 22 January 2020

Social distancing (SD)
Note that the SD compliance level is assumed to be the same, however, it is assumed to be variable and unknown everywhere in the system such as within the public transport system and in regarding the activities of participations.

Facemask usage (FU)
We assume that nobody wear mask at home. 

Date of lockdown (DL)
Thus, we need to make some assumptions, the most important of which is the travel volume after lockdown. As there is no reliable data on the generated trips after lockdown in Sydney GMA (in April 2020) compared to before, we assumed 50% reductions in the total number of trips for calibration purposes.

On recovery from infection, individuals are assumed to be immunised. All the infected agents, either quarantined or not, will be recovered after 14 days which is the typical recovery period of COVID-19.

As the average number of out-of-home activity trips is 2.9 in SydneyGMA, we assume that the contact number per trip for all activity types is a function of occupation and is within the range of 1 to 3.

We also assume that agents with sales (including sales workers) and general (including community and personal service workers, clerical and administrative workers) occupations have higher contact rates compared to the agents with other occupation types with a coefficient placed in the range 1 to 1.5.

Therefore, we can assume all the infected cases have the same daily probability to be traced and quarantined with a daily probability within the range of 0.05 to 0.15.

Note that we do not differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and assume that all the infected cases have the same infectious rates. 

Furthermore, we use the simulation results in Muller et al. (2020) and assume that 23 percent of infections occur on PT vehicles, as the third objective to fit. 

Limitations

Similar to every other model, SydneyGMA has several limitations. First, SydneyGMA is developed by transferring GTAModel V4.1, which is originally developed for Greater Toronto-Hamilton Area (GTHA). Transferring is a common approach in developing agent-based models because there is no immediate need for re-estimation of parameters (Bowman et al., 2014; Castiglione et al., 2014). While the socioeconomic data, network datafiles and procedures for Sydney has been used for the development of SydneyGMA, there are still some parameters that need to be estimated and replaced. As the paper objective is to investigate different control strategies comparatively, we believe that being at this stage of transferring does not affect our scenario analysis remarkably. Second, SydneyGMA incorporates all the travel and out-of-home activity participation decisions and household profiles of each agent, it is not able to explicitly model out-of-home interactions among agents at a micro “fact-to-face” level. While the model generates the activity type and the zone where an agent participates in an out-of-home activity, it does not provide detailed information about other agents who have been in contact with this agent at the specific activity location (e.g., a store) at the specific time of the agent’s visit to this location. Thus, we had randomly pick interacting agents from those who were in the same zone and activity level and overlap at the attendance time. The same assumption has been used for the PT mode. Third, the SydneyGMA does not provide the specific PT vehicle that is used by each agent. Thus, we select interacting agents from those that use the PT mode to get to the same destination and activity type with approaching times that are close to each other. Assumptions made about the transport model do not affect the conclusions drawn from the relative analysis conducted in Sect. Runs and results section, as the intention of the paper is not to provide accurate forecasts, instead it is aimed to assess the relative costs and benefits of different conferment policies.",No,"Data availability
Regarding the SydneyGMA, it has been originally developed for Toronto, Canada and then it has been transferred to few other cities worldwide. We cannot make the SydneyGMA publicly available as it is in the discretion of the inventors. Also, this model uses the EMME package for auto and transit assignment as well as estimation of travel time where EMME is not an open source software. Furthermore, we have borrowed the road and transit network of Sydney from “Transport for NSW “ organization, and we are not allowed to share it beyond the research team. Thus, we have only cited few publications discussing the development of the model. Most importantly, we have cited the webpage of the agent-based model in the revised paper (see https://tmg.utoronto.ca/doc/1.4/gtamodel/index.html).

The conditions actually required for an infection via indirect transmission are, as for direct transmission, largely unknown, making more realistic modeling impractical.

Values estimated for FA in an epidemic depend on the method applied and the spreading dynamics [54].

Full Screening or sampling screening. When the frequency of Full Screening increased from five to seven times/week (which resulted in a 2581 increase in the number of tests per positive case), the cumulative infection rate was only reduced by 2%. Screening all people weekly by splitting them equally into seven batches could reduce infection rates by 73% compared to once per week, which was similar to Full Screening four times/week. Full Screening had the highest number of tests per positive case, while the miss rate, number of tests per positive case, and hotel quarantine

By simulating the spread of Omicron variant, 87 different screening strategies with different sampling methods, frequencies, and timings of screening were evaluated in terms of the cumulative infection rate, miss rate, tests per positive case identified, and the consumption of quarantine and medical resources.

Once the infection rate reached a threshold (5/10,000 used for our simulation), NPIs would be implemented (household members are quarantined at home, but they could go out when necessary, such as purchasing necessities and seeking medical treatment). S

At the same frequency, the timing of screening affected epidemic control. For Full Screening as an example, although the frequency of both the Shanghai Strategy and Beijing Strategy was five times/week, the number of infections of the former was less than that of the latter in the early period, but the opposite was true in the later period (Fig. 2a).

The daily number of infections during the outbreak assuming the Shenzhen Strategy (nine times every 2 weeks) was between that of screening four times/week and screening five times/week (being quite close to the latter).

As for the timings of screening in batches, IRcum of screening at the end of the week was higher than that of the other three options under the strict social distancing measures,

With increasing screening frequency or increasing batches in which a weekly screening was split, the cumulative and peak resource consumption of hotel quarantine increased while the medical resources in shelter hospitals and hospitals decreased (Figs. 5, 6). An exception was the threshold for hotel quarantine. Specifically, when the frequency exceeded three times/week, the cumulative and peak hotel quarantine resource of Full Screening decreased, simultaneously the cumulative and peak of quarantine and medical resource for Full Screening were less than that for the two sampling strategies.",Stay at home; Get tested;  contact tracing,"It considered NPIs, such as testing, tracing, and isolation, and changes in testing sensitivity due to changes in the viral load of infected individuals over time.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumed, assuming, assumption

symptom-based tests were administered on the first day that symptoms appeared.

For (iii), we assumed that 70% of infected individuals develop clinical symptoms [51, 60, 61], 20% of which develop severe/critical symptoms [52]. 

We assumed no difference in average time to symptom onset for mild symptomatic and severe symptomatic cases.

Demographic and clinical indications were used to administer swabs and tests, beginning on the first day of each outbreak simulation and assuming a daily maximum testing capacity ranging from 1 to 32 tests/day. We assumed a 24-h lag from swab to test result, perfect specificity (true negative rate) and imperfect sensitivity (true positive rate). 

We estimated a 0.7% reduction in test sensitivity per additional negative specimen added to a group sample when assuming a typical RT-PCR Cycle threshold cut-off (Ct = 40), and for sensitivity ana-
lysis estimated a faster rate (1.3%) corresponding to a stricter threshold (Ct = 35) (see Additional File 1). 

We further assumed that no individuals refused swabbing/testing.

As with actual COVID-19, we assumed that 20% of these individuals also present with severe symptoms.

We defined a maximum detection lag of 22 days, after which all outbreaks were assumed to be detected regardless of the surveillance strategy used.

We ran a range of sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in (i) how SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into the LTCF, (ii) LTCF size and structure, (iii) transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and (iv) diagnostic sensitivity of RT-PCR for individual samples and (v) for group samples (see assumptions in Additional File 1).

Compared to the baseline protocol, which assumed a maximum of 32 swabs/test, group testing was less effective given fewer swabs
per test, despite potentially higher test sensitivity.

The reference used the fewest swabs and tests, on average < 1/day regardless of the assumed daily testing capacity (owing to a low daily incidence of severe COVID-like symptoms).

This is regarded as the most straightforward approach [35], and
we conservatively assumed re-swabbing in addition to re-testing of all individuals in a positive group test to account for potential logistical challenges of storing and maintaining large numbers of swabs for re-testing. 

To reflect a scenario with more effective testing technology, in a sensitivity analysis, we assumed higher and more stable RT-PCR sensitivity over the course of infection.

Findings for group testing, however, necessarily assume that pooling clinical samples is both logistically feasible and retains sufficient
diagnostic sensitivity, as demonstrated for RT-PCR and SARS-CoV-2.

This work has several limitations. First, substantial uncertainties remain regarding epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. 

Second, LTCFs represent a diverse range of healthcare institutions, each with unique specializations, patient populations and living conditions, and the generalizability of our findings across these settings is not clear.

Finally, the testing landscape for COVID-19 is due to, shift quickly, with increased testing capacity and alternative testing technologies, such as rapid diagnostic tests, likely to become increasingly available in the coming months and years.

Two students enrolled in the same event were assumed to have contact with each other and the responsible lecturers. If more than a single lecturer was responsible for an event, they were also assumed to have contact with each other. 

Recovered agents are assumed to be completely immune to reinfection.

The base transmission risk β is calibrated to reflect the observed transmission dynamics in Austrian secondary schools, following Lasser et al [20], which we assume to be similar to the university context (see Supplementary Materials for details). 

This includes immunity from previous infection with other variants of the virus but assumes a population naive to infection with the Omicron variant, as was the case in Austria in October 2021. 

Our simulations assume testing and isolation of agents as soon as they show symptoms.

Assumptions + Limitations (latter implied)

Because our model rests on a set of assumptions, an analysis of its shortcomings and the uncertainties associated with these assumptions is warranted. Our model does not include contact situations apart from courses on the university premises. This is a deliberate choice: including such contacts would correspond to multiple concurrent introductions of the infection into the university network, which would further increase the number of transmissions in the university context. Since even without the inclusion of such contacts outbreak sizes are already large, we do not think that adding such contacts would add additional information to our study, while it would introduce a number of additional assumptions to our model. We note that, owing to this assumption, the outbreak sizes reported here are a lower bound to the outbreak dynamics that are to be expected. We base our contact network on enrollment data of students for courses. Not all students that enroll in a given event show up, as there often is no mandatory attendance, especially under the current circumstances. The density of the contact network used in our simulation in the case of 100% occupancy is therefore an upper bound of the number of contacts caused by the courses organized by the university.

We calibrated our model using empirical observations of distributions of cluster sizes in Austrian secondary schools in autumn 2020 [20]. University students tend to have sparser schedules than students in secondary schools, resulting in an overall decreased duration of contact time between people. On the other hand, the space available per student in university lecture halls is on average smaller than for students in secondary schools (see 
for details). It is hard to quantify the difference in contact intensity that the difference in contact duration and proximity introduce. Nevertheless, the differences act in different directions and are expected to at least partially cancel each other. We therefore think it is warranted to assume that contact situations in universities and secondary schools are similar enough to use the available data on outbreaks in school settings to calibrate our simulation for an application in the university context.",No,https://github.com/ JanaLasser/uni_SEIRX,No,,Three or more different disciplines,"Computer and Information Sciences, Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Industry","Computer science, Health Sciences, Education","Graz University of Technology, Institute for Interactive Systems and Data Science, Graz, Austria

We adjust this transmission risk to match the Omicron variant, which is about 3 times as transmissible as the Delta variant [21], which itself is about 2.25 times as transmissible as the original strain [22, 23]. This results in a transmission risk of 18.7% per contact for unvaccinated agents in a university setting

We therefore report Reff averaged over the first 100 time steps of the simulation. Distributions of Reff for the 6 scenarios are shown in Figure 3.

Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is still being evaluated at the point of writing, but we assume that 50% effectiveness is very optimistic, as Omicron has demonstrated significant immune escape capabilities [39].

Model scenarios

We considered a range of 10% to 30% preexisting immunity (i.e., seropositivity prior to vaccination) in the population, with 20% for the base-case scenario [44,45]. To parameterize the model at a given level of preexisting immunity, we ran simulations in the absence of vaccination and derived the infection rates in different age groups once the overall attack rate reached the pre-specified level.

We simulated the model with a 10,000 population for a time horizon of 1 year to evaluate the impact of DSD vaccination compared with the recommended schedule of 28-day interval for Moderna vaccines and 21-day interval for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. For the results presented here, outcomes of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths were averaged over 1,000 independent replications of each scenario. Credible intervals (CrIs) at the 5% significance level were generated using the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method (with 500 replications)",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Get medical treatment,"Infection outcomes
A proportion of severe symptomatic cases were hospitalized within 2 to 5 days of symptom onset [25,35], and thereafter did not contribute to the spread of infection. We assumed that all mild symptomatic cases and severely ill (not hospitalized) individuals self-isolated within 24 hours of symptom onset. 

Vaccination
We implemented a 2-dose vaccination campaign and simulated a rollout strategy with a daily rate of 30 vaccine doses per 10,000 population, corresponding to 1 million vaccine doses per day for the entire US population. ",Yes,"The daily number of contacts during self-isolation was reduced by an average of 74%, based on a matrix derived from a representative sample population during COVID-19 lockdown [36].

The lengths of non-ICU and ICU stays were sampled from Gamma distributions with means of 12.4 and 14.4 days, respectively [39,40]

As an additional scenario, we extended our analysis to a daily vaccination rate of 45 doses per 10,000 population, corresponding to 1.5 million daily doses in the US.

Vaccine coverage of the entire population with 2 doses under the recommended schedules reached 51% and 76% for Moderna, and 52% and 77% for Pfizer-BioN Tech with vaccination rates of 30 and 45 doses per day, respectively, within 1 year.

We sampled daily contacts within and between age groups from a negative binomial distribution parameterized using an empirically determined contact network (Table A in S1 Text) [27]

Using recent estimates, we parameterized the infectivity of asymptomatic, mild symptomatic, and severe symptomatic individuals to be 26%, 44%, and 89%relative to the presymptomatic stage [28–30]. For each infected individual, the incubation period was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 5.2 days [31]. A proportion of infected individuals developed symptomatic disease following a presymptomatic stage. The duration of the presymptomatic stage and infectious period following symptom onset was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 2.3 days and 3.2 days, respectively [29,32,33]. Those who did not develop symptomatic disease remained asymptomatic until recovery, with an infectious period that was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 5 days [33,34].

Vaccine coverage of the entire population with 2 doses under the recommended schedules reached 51% and 76% for Moderna, and 52% and 77% for Pfizer-BioN Tech with vaccination rates of 30 and 45 doses per day, respectively, within 1 year.

In order to evaluate the impact of vaccination with DSD relative to the tested schedules in clinical trials, in the base-case scenario, we assumed that the efficacy of the first dose for both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines would be maintained for up to 18 weeks without a second dose. As a sensitivity analysis, we considered a waning rate of 5% per week for first dose vaccine efficacy starting from week 7 after the first dose. We assumed that the full 2-dose efficacy was achieved regardless of delay in the administration of the second dose from the recommended schedule [43]. We simulated the model with the mean, lower bound, and upper bound of the 95% CIs for vaccine efficacy of the first and second doses against infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease.

It was, therefore, assumed that the source of transmission during this period was mainly the marketplaces, in a country like India where only 1.6% of the population has access to online shopping.[3]

Based on this study, this mathematical model has assumed a similar effect of viral load on transmission dynamics; other assumptions include higher mortality among elderly subjects, population density in the market places being high enough to represent the population density of the aforementioned study.

Several assumptions have been made on the basis of observational data: 1. Markets are the main source of spread of infection. 2. A person with low viral load will infect 0.8 persons when going to market. Among the superspreaders, that is, persons with moderate and high viral load will infect 3 and 7 persons respectively when going to market[8] 3. The viral load distribution in the population is same in all age groups, 84% constituting low viral loads, 9% moderate viral loads, and 7% high viral loads[8] 4. Percentage of low viral load in hospitalized participants is 61%, whereas moderate/high viral load makes up 39% of the hospitalized participants[7] 5. Asymptomatic COVID cases have been considered with the assumption that 30% of infections will not produce symptoms In case of ct intervention (3rd and 4th group), people with high/moderate viral loads have 1/3rd of their contacts randomly traced and tested 7. In case of current strategy of testing, isolation and contact tracing, 1/3rd of contacts of the individual are randomly tested regardless of viral load 8. Family structure consists of four members per family 9. One person from each family is designated to go to the markets, which means 25% of the total population goes to the markets. This market going population consists of elderly (>60 years) and younger adults (<60 years) 10. The elderly (>60 years) comprises 7.4% of the West Bengal population[10] 11. 2.96% of the total market going population comprises of elderly people 12. Probability of death was assumed to be independent of viral load 13. Mortality rate figures have been taken from West Bengal Government data on mortality.[9]

However, this model has assumed perfection in the quality and reporting of the testing.

Incongruence in mortality [Figure 2], however, is believed to be due to the following reasons: a. For a period of time in West Bengal, mortality statistics did not include COVID positives whose deaths could possibly be contributed by comorbidities b. Most recorded deaths are hospital deaths and it is likely that many deaths in the community, particularly those with multiple comorbidities happened before any opportunity for testing. The Model, on the other hand, will pick up all COVID positive deaths in both hospitals and community.

The increase in VE against symptomatic disease from boosters in our simulations could be achieved through multiple combinations of increases in VE against infection and VE against progression to symptoms.

Our model assumes that all infections are with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, the dominant variant across the United States in August 2021 [9].

We compare 2 vaccination strategies: (1) varying staff vaccination coverage between 40% and 100% and (2) giving a booster dose to all vaccinated residents (assuming coverage in residents remains at 80%). The VE against infection following a booster is uncertain, so we consider a range from 60% to 90%.

COVID-19 clinical monitoring data came from IGSS, the General Inspectorate of Social Security of Luxembourg [23]. Interventions were otherwise parametrized using public knowledge, for example on the timing of lockdowns.

We assume that there is a delay between agents receiving an invitation for large scale testing and the booking of the test. We assume this delay is distributed randomly as in Fig 10, the data for this having being collected by General Inspectorate of Social Security in Luxembourg in 2020.

We assume that the capacity of the test laboratory is limited by the 7-day rolling average of the total number of tests recorded each day in Luxembourg.

This shows, approximately, the dates on which test invitations were sent in Luxembourg and the numbers of invitations sent on those dates.

We set low, medium and high daily first dose availability equivalent to 0.2%, 0.6% and 1.0% of the total population, respectively, resulting in the Luxembourg implementation at daily first dose capacities of 1621, 4864 and 8107, respectively.

An online survey conducted by science.lu in Luxembourg in December 2021 [97] suggested that vaccine hesitancy levels were fairly high in Luxembourg, with only 55% of participants being likely or very likely to get aCOVID-19 vaccine. Breaking down by age, the survey suggested that in the age group 13-34, only 48% were likely or very likely to get vaccinated, 57% in the age group 35-64 and 80% in the age group 65+. For our simulations, we decompose according to the same age groups with low, medium and high vaccine hesitancy levels for each age group parametrized as in Table 12. For example, for the low hesitancy scenario we assume that agents aged 65+ refuse the vaccine with probability 0.10, while for the high hesitancy scenario we assume agents aged 16-34 refuse the vaccine with probability 0.75, representing the two extremes.

Methods

Interaction. If two agents occupy the same location for the same 10 minute interval, then it is assumed that an interaction occurs that with some probability results in disease transmission. The nature of this interaction is assumed to be uniform across all location types. While in reality location type or activity might be important factors in determining the probability of transmission, in the absence of relevant data we make no such hypotheses, assuming uniformity of interactions for simplicity.

There is also a single outdoor location Outdoor, in which we assume zero disease transmission, and a Cemetery, to which agents are moved after death

We assume agents will tend to prefer locations close to, for example, their home.

Since we set the spatial coordinates of a location by sampling the (interpolated) population distribution, we assume that all types of location are distributed as population is distributed.

We assume that populations of cross-border workers consist only of adults, that the age of cross-border workers is distributed identically to that of adults in the resident population, and that cross-border workers travel to the region for work and for no other reason. We do not model air travel nor other long distance connections between regions.

We assume that each care home contains 38 residents. We will assume that no internal transmission occurs within the neighbouring countries, focussing instead on transmission within the central region only.

In the case of schools, we assume that if a school is full then the next nearest school is selected instead, ensuring that classroom sizes are uniform across the region. Moreover we assume that children from the same household attend the same primary and secondary schools.

We assume that agents only move to a new location when starting a new activity.

We do not assume limits on hospital and intensive care capacity, since we lack appropriate data.

We assume that α = 0.55, meaning that asymptomatic and pre-clinically infectious agents are only 55% as infectious as the symptomatic infectious agents [90]. In the absence of personal protective measures, we assume that the transmission probability p is uniform across location types, except outdoors (including construction sites) and in the border countries, where it is set to zero.

Interventions

We assume perfect compliance with all interventions, except face masks and vaccination. In the case of face masks, we assume that low face mask availability results in some agents not wearing the masks, while for vaccination we will consider the possibility that agents refuse the vaccine.

Testing... While this process is based on the system of large scale testing used in Luxembourg, where test invitations were not distributed completely randomly, we assume for simplicity that they are. We assume that there is a delay between agents receiving an invitation for large scale testing and the booking of the test. We assume this delay is distributed randomly as in Fig 10, the data for this having being collected by General Inspectorate of Social Security in Luxembourg in 2020... We assume that if an agent has symptoms then the test takes place two days after the booking, while if an agent does not have symptoms then, given a lesser sense of urgency, it takes place four days after the booking. A laboratory process then performs the tests, returning results after two days with a 1% probability of a false negative. In addition, we assume that the laboratory is only able to perform a limited number of tests per day, the exact capacity being scenario-specific.

Face masks. According to the preprint [91], the effect of face masks can be modelled in
terms of the mask transmission rate and mask absorption rate, which denote the proportions of viruses that are stopped by the mask during exhaling versus inhaling, respectively. This was also the approach taken in [24]. We assume these proportions are equal

Vaccination... We assume the vaccine is administered in a two-dose format, with a fixed time between doses. We assume that the first and second doses protect the recipient with probabilities p1 and p2, respectively... We assume, for simplicity, that agents are either totally protected against infection or not at all... Moreover we assume that everyone who receives a first dose later receives the second dose. We assume that only a certain number of first doses of the vaccine can be administered each day and that agents are vaccinated in a particular order... We also assume that agents refuse vaccination with a certain probability, depending on their age.

Model evaluation

Testing. We assume that the capacity of the test laboratory is limited by the 7-day rolling average of the total number of tests recorded each day in Luxembourg. 

Contact tracing. We assume that contract tracing starts on 20th April 2020 with a capacity of 100. 

Face masks. We assume that agents do not initially have access to face masks, the probability that they do increasing to 0.8 on 20th April 2020 and from 0.8 to 1.0 on 11th May 2020. We assume that the probability of a mask being worn, given that masks are available, depends of the type of location. We assume this probability is 0.0 inside houses and cars and 1.0 inside public transport, shops, medical clinics, hotels, places of worship and museums and zoos. Elsewhere we assume this probability is 0.2. We assume moreover that in hospitals and medical clinics face masks are always available and that they are always worn.

Location closure... In addition, we assume that 72% of shops, chosen at random, close from 15th March 2020 to 11th May 2020, since according to [85] approximately this percentage of shops in Luxembourg do not sell either food, drink or fuel and were therefore subject to such restrictions.

Vaccination

Herd immunity... We performed several simulations in which we assumed that a certain percentage of the population had pre-existing immunity... Also, with a view towards COVID-19 vaccination programmes starting in early 2021, such as in Luxembourg where a significant proportion of the population is already immune having been previously exposed to the disease, we will assume for all subsequent experiments that 10% of the population have pre-existing immunity. 

Hesitancy...  In particular, we assume that with a certain probability agents refuse the vaccine when offered it. We assume that these probabilities are age dependent and that they remain constant throughout the simulation... 

Limitations (implied)

We assumed hesitancy levels to be constant
throughout the simulation, although in reality hesitancy levels can change over time. For
example, as more people are vaccinated, hesitancy levels might decrease as familiarity with the vaccine increases. On the other hand, as more people are vaccinated the likelihood of somebody experiencing unusual side effects of the vaccine increases, with news of this potentially increasing hesitancy levels. While we have assumed a model of vaccine hesitancy that acts on the level of the individual, hesitancy can also manifest itself at a higher level, with policy makers themselves hesitant to implement the vaccine. Moreover, we have only simulated the use of a single vaccine. A future study would have several being administered simultaneously, starting on different dates, with different properties and with potentially different levels of hesitancy associated to them. Such considerations are beyond the scope of the present study.

Limitations

Let us finish with some final remarks about the limitations of the model and directions for future research. Firstly, confidence in our results would be further improved with a more sophisticated statistical analysis of uncertainty, which would require several computational optimizations, in order to reduce runtime. This may involve validating our model using data collected in other countries, besides only Luxembourg. Obtaining all the data necessary to do this is difficult, and was therefore deemed beyond the scope of the present work.

Moreover our behavioural model could be further enhanced, by introducing correlations between individuals, for example families, and with agent behaviour adjusting automatically in response to a pandemic event, even in the absence of organized interventions.

One notable limitation of our study, is that our interpretation of vaccine efficacy is relatively simple, based on an all-or-nothing model of immunity. A more sophisticated model of immunity, distinguishing immunity against infection from immunity against transmission, and also immunity against symptomatic illness or severe disease, would be more realistic and could lead to interesting conclusions. We have also not considered factors such as partial immunity, waning immunity, cross immunity for multiple variants and multiple vaccines. The all-or-nothing model of immunity is assumed for simplicity, with this assumption often being found in the literature.

Furthermore, new strains of COVID-19 present new challenges, but we have not simulated the impact of different strains, nor attempted to model competition between strains. We speculate that social distancing and testing exert an evolutionary pressure on the virus that increases the reward for any mutation that makes the virus more transmissible or less easily detected. The simulation of such a competitive system is an objective for future research, with uncertainties surrounding the strains a major reason why we have not made any concrete predictions about the future. Since we are ourselves a part of the system that we are trying to model, and therefore not independent from it, to a certain extent we would be doomed to fail anyway.",Yes,https://github.com/abm-covid-lux/abmlux,No,,Two different disciplines,"Mathematics and Statistics, Industry",Mathematics (general),"Dept. of Mathematics, University of Luxembourg, Esch sur Alzette, Luxembourg

Similarly, the vaccination statuses of all trainees, staff, and trainers at the start of training camp were estimated using state-level daily data on the number of adults receiving their first, second, and booster doses provided by CDC (IISInfo, 2021). 

Between October 2020 and April 2021, all trainees arriving at Fort Jackson in South Carolina were tested via PCR on arrival and at the end of an initial two-week quarantine period. In addition, we also obtained data for the same dates on the number of symptomatic individuals who tested positive via PCR during the remainder of training camp. This surveillance data was used to calibrate our model and estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) in this setting. Details on the model calibration process are provided below. Due to nature in which the data was collected, this surveillance dataset from Fort Jackson is not publicly available, however requests for access to this data or requests for further details can be made to the Fort Jackson Public Affairs Office at usarmy.jackson.93-sig-bde.mbx.atz-­-pao@army.mil. 

A mask-wearing requirement for trainees, trainers, and staff in camp has been in place throughout the pandemic per CDC guidelines for high-risk settings (Reinhart et al., 2021), except for when trainees were eating, sleeping, or attending to personal hy­giene. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that compliance has not been universal, particularly during periods of low transmission nation­ally. Therefore, we assumed that masking compliance followed the daily reported mask wearing rate for South Carolina as surveyed by Delphi and reported in Covidcast (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020), with an adjust­ment of 2/3 of this value to account for periods when trainees were indoors but not required to wear masks (sleeping, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions ""assum""

(22 results)

We assumed that all new trainees arrive as a single cohort at the beginning of training camp each week and are initially assigned to cocoons containing 60 trainees each, with two trainers assigned to each cocoon. 

We assume that trainees do not leave base during training camp, but that trainers and support staff leave the military base each evening and can therefore become infected in the outside community. 

Trainers were assumed to have contact with all trainees in their assigned cocoon, which continued in the post-cocoon period when cocoons had been merged into larger companies. Support staff were randomly assigned contacts with trainees from any cocoon or company. We assumed that the mean number of contacts per staff member was 20. 

We assume that trainees are tested via PCR on the day that they become symptomatic. 

Following an infection, we assume that an individual is completely immune to reinfection by all variants for the first 30 days due to the immune response to the primary infection. Individuals remained im­mune to reinfection from the same variant from day 30 to day 90 post-infection, after which immunity waned exponentially according to es­timates from Townshend et al (Townsend et al., 2021). 

The first, second, and booster vaccine doses were assumed to provide protection against infection 14 days after the dose was administered.

Assuming that protection against an omicron infection from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was 56 % (Altarawneh et al., 2022), we selected the most plausible relative transmissibility according to the estimates of (Gozzi et al., 2022)

A detailed description of the model assumptions regarding test specificity and sensitivity are provided in Espana et al (Espana et al., 2022).

Therefore, we assumed that masking compliance followed the daily reported mask wearing rate for South Carolina as surveyed by Delphi and reported in Covidcast (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020), with an adjust­ment of 2/3 of this value to account for periods when trainees were indoors but not required to wear masks (sleeping, etc.).

While weekly data on vaccine uptake at arrival was not avail­able, based on anecdotal evidence we assumed that vaccine uptake upon arrival among unvaccinated trainees was 25 % from 05/22/2021 to 06/30/2021, 40 % from 07/01/2021 to 12/26/2021, and 60 % after 12/26/2021. We assumed that the first dose was administered on day 3 of training camp, with the second dose administered 14 days after the first dose. 

For all subsequent training camps, we assumed that there were 1200 trainees, along with 40 trainers and 60 support staff. 

Limitations

4.1. Limitations 

One limitation of our analysis was that while we estimated off-base infections among trainers and support staff, we did not have any observational data with which to validate those estimates. If the infec­tion risk among military staff was different from the estimated risk among adults in Richland County, SC due to differences in their com­munity contact patterns, then these estimates might not accurately reflect the importation pressure from this source. Another limitation of our model is that we did not have detailed information on contact pat­terns among trainees or between trainees and staff during training, and therefore contacts within a training unit were randomly assigned and assumed to be of equal duration and strength. Our model therefore is not capable of capturing the impact of contact heterogeneity among trainees on transmission dynamics or the potential role of superspreaders due to the constraints on the number of contacts each agent can have. Given the importance of transmission from trainers and staff to trainees in our model, it would also be useful to assess whether contacts between trainees and staff actually have the same transmission potential as trainee-trainee contacts. Our model relies on published estimates of the relative transmissibility and immune escape of the major SARS-CoV-variants compared to the original virus (and in the case of omicron, models of plausible estimates) in the calculation of R0 for each variant. Because we did not have data from training camp during the time pe­riods when the delta and omicron variants were circulating, these var­iants did not inform the estimation of R0, and therefore the estimates of R0 for these variants are entirely dependent on assumptions about their relative transmissibility and immune escape. The reported proportion of asymptomatic infections in military trainees used in this study was higher than has been typically observed in the general population. Therefore, our findings may not extrapolate to settings where asymp­tomatic infections are less common. Our sensitivity analysis demon­strated that a higher symptomatic proportion would necessitate a lower R0 value to cause the observed outbreak sizes, and therefore in­terventions could actually be more effective than we estimated. Finally, we did not consider the cost-effectiveness or the feasibility of imple­menting the different interventions included in our analysis. Logistical constraints could outweigh the epidemiological effectiveness of certain interventions depending on the setting.

We estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) for the original SARS-CoV-2 virus in this military training setting by calibrating the model to surveillance data from a U.S. Army training base.

As an alternative, we also cali­brated the model using a higher symptomatic proportion of 0.57, which was estimated from an active SARS-Cov2 screening study in Iceland (Chitwood et al., 2021).

For symptomatic individuals, isolation in the nursing home (for residents) or at home (for staff) begins immediately on symptom onset. For asymptomatic individuals, isolation is not implemented until positive results are returned.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions,"We made the simplifying assumption that the nursing home remains at 100% capacity, with new residents replacing those who have died or been discharged. We assume new resident admissions are not vaccinated or immune from a previous infection but we vary this in a sensitivity analysis (Table S1).

We assume residents do not contact other residents, with the exception of their roommates, and daily contact rates between residents and staff are based on contact rates from nursing homes across the United States (R. Anglo, personal communication; M. Samore, personal communication).

We conduct 2 sensitivity analyses of our assumptions regarding transmission dynamics, lowering the probability of infection given contact (β) and increasing the number of nonroommate resident interactions for each resident.

Infected staff are sent home to recover, resulting in shortages of staff in the nursing home; temporary staff are brought in as replacements once staff falls below 50%, which is a conservative assumption reflecting continued staff shortages [20]. We assume that other than their temporary status, these staff are not different from permanent staff. We assume that there is no turnover among permanent staff. Viral load (ie, number of RNA copies/mL) is modeled stochastically for each infected individual

Importantly, we assume that viral load trajectories for asymptomatic and symptomatic infections are drawn from the same distributions [21, 22]. We model infectiousness categorically, making the assumption that it depends on viral load: not infectious (107 copies/mL).

Although not explicitly modeled, we assume high specificity of antigen tests would be achieved through rapid confirmatory tests.

In all simulations, we assume VE against symptoms—a combination of VES and VEP —is 90%, which is similar to the findings from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials [9, 10].

In scenario 1, we assume that VE against symptoms comes entirely from efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES = 90%) and that efficacy against infectiousness is also high (VEI = 90%). In scenario 2, we assume a lower efficacy against susceptibility to infection and infectiousness and therefore a higher VEP than in scenario 1. In scenario 3, we assume the only protection the vaccine confers is against progression to symptoms (VEP = 90%).

The efficacy from a single dose is set to 50% of the efficacy after the second dose—this is lower than initial studies of the first dose effectiveness [23], making this a conservative assumption.

We have made simplifying assumptions about the logistics of vaccine rollout, with only 2 days for vaccination (1 for each dose); many nursing homes conducted vaccinations across 3 days.

We have also made several assumptions regarding contact patterns, including modeling staff as 1 population; in reality, staff have many different responsibilities and levels of interaction with residents that affect the risk of transmission.

In a sensitivity analysis examining the impact of a vaccine with lower efficacy against symptoms and moderate efficacy against infection and infectiousness, the cumulative symptomatic incidence falls between our scenarios 1 and 2 (Figure S3).

In a sensitivity analysis, in which 50% of incoming residents are vaccinated, the total number of symptomatic cases is lower, but staff coverage remains important for reducing cases among residents, and we see the same trends across VE scenarios (Figures S5–S7).

Text:
Figure 2g shows results obtained for different levels of tracing (no tracing, and 20% and 40% tracing) of the contacts of the symptomatic isolated COVID-19 cases.

When 40% or more of the contacts of the detected symptomatic infections are traced and they and their households are quarantined, the ensuing reduction in transmission leads to a noticeable flattening of the epidemic curve and appears to effectively limit the possible resurgence of a second epidemic wave. It is also worth noticing that we assume the absence of other additional and minimally disruptive social-distancing policies such as crowd control, smart working, wearing of masks, and others that could lead to a further reduction of the transmissibility of the virus with respect to our estimates.

We have investigated what fraction of the population would be isolated or quarantined under the proposed contact-tracing and isolation strategy",Stay at home; Get tested;  contract testing,"TITLE/ABSTRACT

To simulate social-distancing measures, we modify the synthetic population such that:

•	 School closures are simulated by removing all the schools from the system simultaneously.
•	 Partial ‘stay-at-home’ assumes that all places are open except restaurants, nightlife and cultural places. Closures of these places are simulated by removing the interactions that occur in any place that falls into that category according to Foursquare’s taxonomy of places. This is the situation after the first reopening.
•	 Full lockdown and confinement assume that schools and all non-essential workplaces are closed. Here we close all workplaces except essential ones and remove interactions that occur there. Essential workplaces are: hospitals, salons, barbershops, grocery stores, dispensaries, supermarkets, pet stores, pharmacies, urgent care centers, dry cleaners, drugstores, maternity clinics, medical supplies and petrol stations.",No,,,,,,,,,,,, Unclear: Not stated,,No,,Assumptions,"The model assumes a basic reproductive number, R0=2.5, which together with the other parameters (Supplementary Table 1) yields a generation time Tg=6.6d.

The stay-at-home order is lifted as in the previous scenario. Once partial reopening is implemented, we assume that 50% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases can be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, on average, within 2d after the onset of symptoms and that they are isolated at home and their household members are quarantined successfully for 2 weeks (a sensitivity analysis for lower rates of isolation and quarantine is presented in the Supplementary Information).

We also assume that a fraction of the non-household contacts (we show results for 20% and 40%) of the symptomatic infections can be traced and quarantined along with their household—note that we consider that the contacts are identifed with a rate proportional to the duration of the interaction with the symptomatic individual.

It is also worth noticing that we assume the absence of other additional and minimally disruptive social-distancing policies such as crowd control, smart working, wearing of masks, and others that could lead to a further reduction of the transmissibility of the virus with respect to our estimates

These results were obtained under several assumptions. There are very large uncertainties around the transmission of SARS-CoV-2; in particular, about the fraction of subclinical and asymptomatic cases and their transmission. Estimates of age-specific severity are informed by the analysis on individual-level data from China and other countries, and subject to change as more US data become available. We also do not include specific co-morbidities or pre-existing conditions of the specific BMA population. For this reason, we perform an extensive sensitivity analysis showing that the modelling results discussed here are robust to the plausible range of parameter values for the key time-to-event intervals of COVID-19 (for example, incubation period, serial interval, time from symptom onset to hospital admission, among other) as well as the fraction of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission (Supplementary Information). We are also not considering here potential changes to the virus transmissibility due to environmental factors, in particular seasonal drivers such as temperature and humidity. The modelling does not consider possible reintroduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the population from infected travellers. Strategies based on testing, isolation, and contact tracing might be hampered by the importation through the travel of a large number of infections; thus, travel restrictions and screening may need to be introduced to and from places that show sustained local transmission. Finally, we report in the Supplementary Information the effect of the widespread use in the population of masks or other personal protective equipment that lead to a reduction of the transmissibility of SARS-Cov-2.

Results for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics are shown for the unmitigated scenario (a–c) and the two social-distancing interventions considered: LIFT (d–f) and LET (g,h) scenarios. In both LIFT and LET scenarios, we considered the closure of schools and non-essential places for eight weeks. This is the strictest lockdown period, which is followed by a partial lifting of the stay-at-home policy, the duration of which is set to four weeks.

Finally, a full reopening takes place after the period of partial lifting ends (relevant events are marked with vertical lines). In d–f, no other measures are adopted concurrently to the lifting of the restrictions, whereas in g–i, the reopening is accompanied by an active policy consisting of testing the symptomatic individuals, home isolating them and quarantining (Q.) their household and the households of a fraction of their contacts, as indicated.

Results for the unmitigated scenario are shown in Fig. 2a–c. An unmitigated COVID-19 would have a peak of daily incidence of 25.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.8–26.4) newly infected individuals per 1,000 people.

The stay-at-home order is listed as in the previous scenario. Once partial reopening is implemented, we assume that 50% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases can be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, on average, within 2d after the onset of symptoms and that they are isolated at home and their household members are quarantined successfully for 2 weeks (a sensitivity analysis for lower rates of isolation and quarantine is presented in the Supplementary Information)

As a result, the average number of interactions in the workplace and community layer changes from 10.86 (95% CI: 1.51–42.39) under the unmitigated scenario, to 4.10 (95% CI: 0–23.79) for the partial lockdown and 0.89 (95% CI: 0–8.39) contacts for the stay-at-home pol icy

In Fig. 2d, we show that following the lifting of social distancing, the infection incidence starts to increase again, and the effective reproductive number, which dropped by around 75% and reached values below 1 with the intervention, increases to values up to 2.05 (95% CI: 1.73–2.47) (Fig. 2f).

Secondly, there is slight mention to health behaviors, that being transmission within household or communities. However, there is nothing which specifically states a health behavior at least from what I have seen. 

The study seems to be looking to link COVID infections by similar genomes in the virus from the different people.

While genomic surveillance and the ABM produced congruent results, they still show some difference, for example, recent transmission estimates from ABM were slightly higher than the findings from genomic surveillance, reflecting differences in the scope and detection capacity of these approaches. In addition, the genomic study did not describe transmissions from asymptomatic carriage, while the ABM did not explicitly simulate transmissions in hospitals, residential age care facilities, or introduced by maritime traffic, for example, cruise ships.

When community transmissions are considered within local government areas, which sets an upper bound for all local transmissions, the average local transmissions (across household, household cluster and statistical local area (SLA)), mapped to statistical area level 2 (described in the 2016 national census contexts), reached an upper bound of 34.9% in total (s.d. = 8.2%) of all infections, peaking during the last week at 24.4% per week (s.d. = 5.7%). These fractions are also in strong concordance with their counterparts defined through genomic surveillance (25.8% for all local transmissions, with 17.1–18.3% during the final week; Fig. 4c). As expected, only a proportion of inferred transmission chains were detected by genomic surveillance based on identified COVID-19 cases (Fig.4b).

Comparison of local transmission rates in NSW defined by SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and simulated in Australia by the ABM model. The average over the ten simulation runs is depicted and the error bars represent the minimum and maximum percentages of estimated local transmission events. Genomic surveillance indicates that 25.8% of SARS-CoV-2 cases in NSW are classified as community-based transmission events over the study period, with 18.3% of cases collected in the last week of the study classified as community-based transmission.

We relied on an average sequence depth greater than 200 to ensure the quality of short read mapping and genome comparisons in line with previous reports21,26, although further optimization may be required for sustainable and cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.

The convergent estimates of local transmission from the computational model and genome sequencing not only validated COVID-19 modeling predictions but also suggested that our sampling of COVID-19 cases has been adequate for discovery and monitoring of local transmission events in the time of co-circulation of genomically similar strains of SARS-CoV-2.

The observations of community transmissions obtained using genomic surveillance (25.8% cumulative, with 18.3% during the last week) lay within the uncertainty intervals estimated by the ABM: household/neighborhood-related transmissions (lower bound: 18.6% cumulative, with 11.9% during the last week); and local government area-related estimates (upper bound: 34.9% cumulative, with 24.4% during the last week; Fig.4c).

The synergistic use of genomic surveillance and ABM highlighted the role of transmission within households and local communities, even within a large metropolis such as Sydney, and that genomics data in our context may be less affected by assumptions required for phylogenetic inference and other biases such as sampling density, timing of sample collection and quality of sequencing. Thus, the multimethod ‘socio-genomic’ approach presented in this study for the examination of emerging epidemics makes our findings more robust and aligned with recent calls for caution in applying virus genomic data to public health investigations27,28. Fusion of these two approaches to infer local transmissions reduced overall uncertainty in the scale of the community transmission, presenting actionable inputs for public health policymakers. It must be noted that the actual transmission paths remain uncertain, presenting an open challenge to disease surveillance and warranting further research.

The existence of directed triplet motifs reflects the uncertainty in identifying the transmission source (C1 A2 or A1 A2 in our example), being informed only by temporal dependencies and the context labels. Thus, the inclusion of SLA-wide transmissions provides an upper bound on the extent of community transmission. In other words, transmissions occurring across the wider community are detected to investigate the overall connectivity of emerging local ‘clusters’. The COVID-19 model has been validated with the most recent disease surveillance data, being able to predict both the incidence and prevalence peaks in early to mid-April 2020 (ref. 20).

Bootstrap analysis was conducted on phylogenetic tree approximation. 1000 bootstraps were achieved successfully. The agent-based model simulation was repeated ten times to estimate reproducibility of model estimates."

-	In OpenABM-Covid19, transmission between infected and susceptible individuals through a contact is determined by several factors, including the duration since infection, susceptibility of the recipient (a function of age), and the type of network where it occurred (home networks assume a higher risk of transmission due to the longer duration and close proximity of the exposure). Individuals progress through stages of susceptible, infected, recovered, or deceased

Limitations
-	As a result, we believe that continued social distancing and limiting person-to-person interactions is essential

-	We use a high RT-PCR test specificity of 0.999, which limits the effects of removing individuals from the network due to false positives rather than actual infections and provides a conservative estimate of the effects of contact tracing

Calibration 
-	 To calibrate OpenABM-Covid19 for Washington state we use components of a Bayesian SEIR model by Liu et al.47 for modeling COVID-19. They extend the classic SEIR model by allowing the infection rate to vary as a function of human mobility and a latent changepoint to account for unobserved changes in human behavior

-	We extend the methodology in Liu et al. to model calibration in OpenABM-Covid19 by applying the time-varying infection rate coefficients to the relevant county-specific parameters that guide user interaction levels and disease transmission likelihood.

Verification 
-	Additionally, we compare the performance of exposure notification to manual contact tracing to (1) establish similarities between relative staffing level and exposure notification adoption and (2) to verify an additive effect of concurrent manual tracing and exposure notification

Sensitivity Analysis 
-	Both sensitivity and specificity are set conservatively for the purposes of the interventions, which trigger exposure notifications and contact tracing on positive results

We wanted to capture the benefits of agent-based modeling (in particular, the ability of such models to simulate the kinds of microscale policies being used to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic), whilst making use of recent advances in software tools and computational methods to minimize the complexity and computation time typically associated with such models.",Propose framework,Generic framework (this model could be used for any disease or to model the spread of disease anywhere),Yes,"To date, Covasim has been used by researchers and public health officials in over a dozen countries.

",No,,Considered and imposed,"Agent behavior is based on a probability (100% of agents quarantine, get tested, or change behavior) but it doesn’t clarify how the agent is making the behavior decision. 

“Contact tracing corresponds to notifying individuals that they have had contact with a confirmed case, so that they can be quarantined, tested, or otherwise change their behavior. Contact tracing in Covasim is parameterized by the probability that a contact can be traced, and by the time taken to identify and notify contacts. Both parameters can vary” 
",Stay at home; Get vaccinated; Wear a mask; Social distance (6ft); Get medical treatment; Practice good hygiene; Get tested;   User-defined interventions that can be dynamically modified at any aspect of the simulation,"Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine

Both built-in and user-defined interventions have full access to the simulation object at each timestep, which means that user-defined interventions can dynamically modify any aspect of the simulation
",Yes," Covasim includes interfaces to automatically load COVID-19 epidemiology data, such as time series data on deaths and diagnosed cases, from several publicly available databases. 

The second method allows the user to enter the
number of tests performed on each day directly, including multipliers on the probability of a
person receiving a test if they have symptoms, are in quarantine, or are over a certain age. This
method will then allocate the tests among the population. If data on the number of daily tests
performed each day are available, the second method is preferable",,,,,,,,,,,No,,No,,Assumptions; Limitations,"Assumptions 
-	The length of time between the start of viral shedding and symptom onset is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of 1.1 days
-	Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals
-	All non-critical cases are assumed to recover, while critical cases either recover or die, with the probability of death increasing with age
-	Evidence is mixed as to whether transmissibility is lower if the infectious individual does not have symptoms [55]. We take a default assumption that it is not, but include a parameter that can be modified as needed depending on the modeling application or context, noting that some studies have used much lower rates of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals
-	Covasim generates random networks by assuming that each person in the modeled population can come into contact with anyone else in the population.
-	Both parameters can vary by type of contact, and can be controlled by the user. For example, it may be reasonable to assume that people can trace members of their household immediately and with 100% probability, while tracing work colleagues may take several days and may be incomplete. 
-	The default reductions for isolation are 70% in the household and 90% in school, work, and community layers, while quarantine is assumed to have lower compliance (40% reduction in the household and 80% in other layers).-	As a consequence, many agent-based models, including Covasim, include an optional ""scaling factor"", where a single agent in the model is assumed to represent multiple people in the real world. A scaling factor of 10, for example, corresponds to the assumption that the epidemic dynamics in a city of 2 million people can be considered as the sum of the epidemic dynamics of 10 identical subregions of 200,000 people each.
-	Individuals in the model who have severe and critical symptoms are assumed to require regular and intensive care unit (ICU) hospital beds, respectively, including ventilation in the latter case
-	Unlike in a compartmental model, where Re can only be estimated by using simplifying assumptions, in an agent-based model, methods 2 and 3 can be implemented by simply counting exactly how many secondary infections are caused by each primary infection
-	By default, Covasim calculates the loss using normalized absolute error. Depending on underlying distributional assumptions, minimizing the normalized absolute error can sometimes give parameter estimates that are equivalent to the estimates that maximize the log-likelihood (or an approximation thereof, as in approximate Bayesian computation [76]). Intuitively, most distributional assumptions mean that larger errors imply a lower log-likelihood. However, we do not make explicit distributional assumptions, so caution is advised with treating them as statistically rigorous likelihoods
-	During the scenario period, we assumed that the number of tests conducted per day would remain constant at the average value from the previous 7 days 
-	. (Note that using actual testing data for this period, rather than assuming a constant number of tests, would have resulted in an even more accurate prediction of diagnoses, though of course these data were not available at the time the prediction was made).
-	This underestimate was likely due to assuming a continuation of infection patterns that occurred over the summer and early fall, during which younger adults were disproportionately infected compared to older ones.
Limitations
-	The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge to the disease modeling community in terms of requiring rapid, accurate predictions, often based on extremely limited data, with consequences of global scale
-	Another tradeoff we encountered is that while the gold standard in simplicity of use remains interactive webapps [86], the limited flexibility such webapps provide means that most Covasim users to date have instead used Python scripts to run analyses
-	Covasim is subject to the usual limitations of mathematical models, most notably constraints around the degree of realism that can be captured

By default, the ""80% forecast interval"" is used, i.e. between the 10th and 90th percentiles of the simulated trajectories. Since these forecast intervals are typically produced by a combination of both stochastic variability (""aleatory uncertainty"") and imperfect knowledge of the ""true"" parameter values (""epistemic uncertainty""), they should not be interpreted as statistically rigorous Bayesian credible intervals."

At any given instance, these factors combine to form a unique decision-making context for each agent (see Figure 3). Faced with these constraining or enabling factors, an agent then decides upon a particular course of action that it considers most satisfying.

such as when they start experiencing symptoms - they may choose to adjust their behavior by, for instance,
quarantining at home and thereby isolating themselves from all agents except those that reside in the same house.",Stay at home; Social distance (6ft); Get medical treatment; Get tested,"Self-quarantining, social distancing, getting treated, getting tested",No,,Yes,"Hofstede Cultural Dimension (HCDs), Basic Value Theory (BVT), Beliefs-Desires-Intentions (BDI), Maslow framework, Self-Determination Theory (SDT), process-based motivation theory of Vroom, Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU), social imitation",Yes,"Note that when agents become aware of their infection status such as when they start experiencing symptoms - they may choose to adjust their behavior by, for instance, quarantining at home and thereby isolating themselves from all agents except those that reside in the same house.",No,,Yes,Agent motives are calculated by registering the expected satisfaction gain (or loss) for each need for each agent during instances of decision-making.,No,,Yes,NetLogo,Yes,ODD+D,Assumptions; Limitations,"'Limitations& recommendations' (section 7.5)

The present work proposed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that simulates the epidemiological and economical effects of COVID-19 pandemic in a closed society, whose results can be generalized for wider contexts and used by governmental rulers to prospect social policies and assess its potential effectiveness in real scenarios.

In a wider perspective, the proposed approach can be used as a decision-support system for the governments and scientific community. Policy-makers can design scenarios and evaluate the effectiveness of social interventions through different simulations, and analyse how the P parameters, in the time horizon of T, can affect the response variables.
