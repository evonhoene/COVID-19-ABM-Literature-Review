# All Models Are Wrong, But Can They Be Useful? Lessons from COVID-19 Agent-Based Models (ABMs): A Systematic Review (2020-2023) 

This repository contains the dataset from a systematic review of 536 COVID-19 ABM studies published between January 2020 and December 2023. Articles were retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, and Wiley on January 30, 2024.

Studies were included if they applied ABMs to simulate COVID-19 transmission. Non-COVID-19 models and review papers were excluded. Each study was evaluated against nine criteria of model usefulness, covering transparency and re-use, interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and evaluation practices.
